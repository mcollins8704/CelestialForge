--- Domain: Assistants (1) (31 Perks) --- 
-Attendants (Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus) (0CP)
Choose: A dozen servo skulls, a five-servitor workforce, or a trio of personalized cherubs. All are dull but reliable servants, coming equipped for a variety of tasks. The patterns of each are easy to re-fit for more specialized work.


-Companion Bracelet (World Seed) (0CP)
        A bracelet housing an evolving AI; although Alliance policy is to hand themselves out to people only after they've gotten their class at level 10, an exception was made for you to get it a bit earlier. Although called a bracelet, there are different forms for different races. Slime people might be injected with a nanite swarm programmed with the same effect, for example. Once you have equipped the bracelet, the AI will adapt itself to gain an ideal personality fitting your own. The AI of a loner might become their perfect friend, that of a rich girl always left alone might become a butler caring for her, and someone living a loveless life might find that their companion AI has all the qualities they'd want in their girlfriend. No matter how your companion AI will end up, they will always end up in your best interest. As they have a photographic memory and see the world through your senses, they can highlight important objects or places you might have missed, jog your memory if you forget something important, or browse through the internet to find information a million times faster than somebody with a human brain would.There are also various upgrades that can add to the functionality of the companion bracelet, such as identifying software allowing your companion AI to scan the Aura of creatures or objects to determine their ability, level, and other information, or even an upgrade to allow an instance of them to live in your brain and tap into your senses to control your body in dangerous situations, or just show the trajectories enemy projectiles will take so you can easily dodge them. For 50 CP each, you can apply one upgrade to your companion bracelet, with no limit on how many you can purchase.


-Stockpiles (Girl's Frontline) (50CP)
        We can't let you set off empty-handed; here's 5000 Ammo, Parts, Rations, and Manpower to get your army started (it takes 30 of each to make a baseline T-Doll, while the most consistently powerful Dolls cost something like 600/400/100/600 for a reliable chance of getting them). Each purchase gets you another 5k.
        * This is not just normal ammo, parts, rations and manpower, you can combine them to make T dolls which are AI-piloted android fire platforms for military operations. Plus the ethereal ‘manpower’.


-A Thinker of Your Own (Hive Queen Quest) (100CP)
        This adorable little guy is about 2 feet long and has all the autistic number crunching power of a supercomputer and a truly limitless attention span, if you set him to a research task he will sit and think about it until he finally makes a breakthrough. Whenever they finish a project he will psionically alert you "WE FINISHED RESEARCH FOR QUEEN!" or "WE MADE THING FOR QUEEN!" If you aren't a queen that's ok too, don't worry he still loves you and would do anything in his power to help you, which is a limited proposition since he is literally just a brain with basically useless legs and little to no motor skills.


-Constructor Drone and AI Kernel (Warhammer 40k: T'au Empire) (100CP)
        This drone is an automated constructor unit, capable of building simple machines and buildings on its own and more complicated structures and technologies under your direct supervision, so long as it has materials to work with. Its tools can be easily customized or replaced with new or different technologies. Moreover, its software includes a kernel that can be used to grow specialized AI and VI systems optimized for various computational substrates and tasks that are always loyal to you.


-Digital Ally | Dum-E and U (Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1) (100CP)
        Digital Ally (50CP)
        Ready and waiting! This A.I. is not truly sapient, but it is still capable of performing extremely complex tasks like controlling a small army of robots or managing the infrastructure of a technologically advanced base... at the same time as overseeing a battlefield and relaying tactical data to you. You can design its personality and appearance to suit your needs, and even give it a classy accent! If you wish, you may import an A.I. or companion into this role.
        Dum-E and U (50CP)
        Okay these robots may not do much, but they've got spirit! ...whatever passes for spirit in robots. Taking the form of single robot arms on treads, they try to do their best to aid you around your home and fulfill your wishes. Along with excellent pattern recognition they're unusually good at assisting with fabrication and mechanical construction of electronics. Just be mindful that you need to word things properly.


-Engine-sister (Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus) (100CP)
        Voluminous red robes cannot hide the curves beneath, to this woman's eternal embarrassment. Friendly and perky in conversation to both man and machine, she is torn between her desire to be closer to the machine and her attachment to humanity. The possibility of a harmonious union between the two has inspired her to follow you. She has all 100, 200, and 400cp enginseer perks. She also has 'subtle bionics' 'artisan' and one pick of 'magos designation.'
		
		Machinery is as mysterious as the workings of the warp to the average Imperial - it would take all day to explain why even the simplest rituals are performed and what they do. So by necessity you've become very good at getting people to shut up and let you work in peace. A few curt words is enough to satisfy anyone's curiosity, or to make someone less technically-inclined understand why certain things need doing and to justify the time and expense of doing so.
		
		While already designed to be incredibly robust, Imperial equipment inevitably requires maintenance. You can locate and identify problems within a machine in a fraction of the time it would take other adepts. Not knowing how a machine functions does not make fixing it any more difficult so long as you have the proper parts, tools, and rituals to guide your hands.
		
		Behind the mighty engines and clanking gears of Imperial armor are smaller yet no less important components. Servicing those delicate elements requires a fine touch, and you work with steadiness and precision. Your hands and other appendages will not twitch from surprise or adrenaline, and they will exert the exact amount of force you desire and no more. Exactly how precisely you can work is subject only to the limits of your perceptions.
		
		You have mastered the ancient technical rite of 'if it doesn't work, smack it with a wrench until it does.' Small problems like loose gears can be quickly and permanently fixed with one good whack. When a larger problem impedes a machine's function, continuous pounding and irate prayer can cajole it to miraculously perform one last, brief task, but no more. At that point, this rite will have no more effect until the device receives proper attention.
		
		The scale of the Imperial war machine is incomprehensible to most minds. It is nothing less than a miracle that the Guard and Navy can function at all, given the myriad logistical issues involved. But miracles are something you can provide, as long as you are directly involved in overseeing the distribution or production of a needed resource. You'll always seem to somehow end up with more than with what you started, and this effect increases the greater the scale that you work with. An hour of overseeing the fabrication of lasrifles may net you a dozen extra units at no extra cost, while distributing the output of an agri-world may produce a year's worth of extra rations for an entire Guard regiment.
		
		Long experience with putting things together inevitably teaches one the best way to take something apart. Whether disabling an unruly machine or cracking open a heretek's fortress, you can quickly pick out design flaws, blind spots, and points of failure. Exploiting these weaknesses makes your actions many times more effective. Structures crumble, armor buckles, systems seize up, power surges dangerously out of control, and ammo stores seem to cook off at the slightest provocation. Should you show mercy and attempt to repair what you have laid low, the damage will be far less than it appears and restoring the machine to service will be much less difficult than expected.


-Magos miscellaneous (Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus) (100CP)
        This man's(?) flesh is hidden beneath extensive augmentation. He has been with the Mechanicus for centuries, and his interests are many. Less puritanical than most, the possibility of extending the quest for knowledge to dimensions unknown to the Cult appeals to him. He has all of the 100, 200, and 400cp magos errant perks, and three picks of Magos Designation.


-R2 Series Astromech Droid (Star Wars Clone Wars) (100CP)
        A small automated mechanic that can perform a variety of repair duties and serve as an additional navigational computer on a starfighter. Astromech droids can also connect to and operate the mainframes of large starships and space stations.


-Soma the Sophon (Endless Space) (100CP)
        Make way, we got a mad scientist on our hands! Soma is an overly curious, hyperactive, far too smart for their own good, know-it-all that loves nothing more than to create new devices. Even if she doesn't know exactly what it will do, she just LOVES to build things and experiment. She's a bit of an oddball for her kind, being surprisingly fit from all her years working in her shop, and loves to show off her physical and mental prowess at any opportunity
        Plus: She be SWOLE, even if she is only 4'6
        Plus: Her brain is her biggest muscle
        Netural: Loves to experiment with her new gadgets. May accidentally cause a hull breach doing so,might quintuple your ships reactor output for a few days.
        Minus: Expect a LOT of lab accidents. Hope you have a good medic onboard..


-Bond of Brotherhood (Final Fantasy X) (200CP)
You may very well be only one of many Guardians defending your Summoner – and frankly, the more Guardians there are on the task, the less likely anyone is to fall. There’s safety in numbers after all. Travelling with a group of Guardians, it’s only natural that you’ll come to bond with them.
The longer you fight alongside the same companions, the more in sync you will be with those companions. Alongside these trusted companions, you’ll find that their abilities seem to boost yours, increasing the effects of your abilities by a small bit for each companion nearby.


-Ding! (Girl Genius SB) (200CP)
        Well, this is different. A certain gentleman called Von Neumann would be delighted, at least. You are now the proud master of a full set of Dingbots of your own, or similar clanks or drones, at least. They're all minor sparks in their own rights, and can themselves build more of their kind, even though those don't have the spark.
        Led by a Prime, they are connected with you on an intrinsic, mental level, being fully capable of building any and all devices or works you can. They get everywhere, performing construction upkeep, salvage and everything else you might need them to. Not even needing blueprints, they seem to draw upon your knowledge directly, using their in-built tools to perform all the things you normally would need to do yourself, making everything you'd like them to... and a lot of them you wouldn't.
        Don't leave them unsupervised.


-Garment Gloves (Dodgeball) (200CP)
        These are a pair of pure white gloves. Bound to them is an intelligence with a mind for fashion: a designer, seamstress, clothier, and tailor without a mortal peer. It has the ability to scry for fashion based information from international trends to precise measurements. Given materials and orders, it will industriously produce fine apparel, producing any modifications, clothing, footwear, accessories, etc that is within theoretical mortal ability. It has sufficient telekinesis to move itself and to independently suspend materials. It must be provided with materials, though it may be provided a lump sum or budget with which to magically acquire materials at cost. You may wear the gloves to channel the skills (but not powers) of the entity, perhaps even learning from it.


-Huragok Ally (Halo - UNSC) (200CP)
        Something of a surprise and most definitely an attention-grabber, a Huragok is supposed to be one of the members of the Covenant Homogeny and has normally been seen only in their presence. Yet Huragok, also known by those in the UNSC as 'Engineers', are primarily pacifistic and dedicate themselves purely to repairing and working on any technology around them. This particular one seems to have gotten lost and ended up deciding to follow you for the sake of making sure your technology was functioning. Aside from melodic whistling sounds that sound slightly similar to Earth whales, Huragoks communicate using either sign language with their tendrils or through text messaging thanks to their penchant of being biological supercomputers. Huragok are highly prized for being able to fix almost anything they touch, and you should expect a lot of questioning if someone spots you with one.


-Leonardo Da Vinci (Europa Universalis) (200CP)
        You stand in the presence of one of the greatest inventors of this age, jumper. He is well known for his efforts to build a helicopter and a solar powered beam weapon, even in renaissance times. While he lacked the technology to bring his visions into reality and thus, died scorned, you will certainly be able to bring him the tools and the tech he needs to become the best inventor in the multiverse


-Sexy Evil Tailor (Dungeon Keeper Ami) (200CP)
        This is a deed to a tailors shop with included dark elf tailor, he knows exactly what is needed to make a person look their most sexy, evil, and impressive, able to create clothes for any shape and size ranging from leather strips covering the important bits all the way up to dark billowing cloaks. No matter what look you are going for he can help you pull it off and look good doing it, though he normally works for gold he will accept any currency and at the end of the week he will give you your portion of the profits made from other customers. You will receive a new deed every jump to place as you wish. Beware though, he does try to push the leather underwear look


-Soul of the Forge (World of Warcraft) (200CP)
        This spirit that manifests as a small, cyclopean golem made of molten metal and shards, the Soul of the Forge dwells within the workshops and smithies of metalworkers. So long as it is content, all who work within that forge's walls will find their creations blessed: The individual pieces, parts, and techniques required coming together that much easier, and the end result being that much more splendid.' In order for the Soul of the Forge to dwell, one also requires a small kiln to house the spirit.


-Key of Avatars | Hierarchy of Souls (Lords of the Night Liches) (300CP)
        Key of Avatars (200CP)
        Upon buying this perk you gain access to the first level of the Arcana of Avatars, and will naturally deepen your understanding and power in it over time with no more personal investment in that growth.
        The Arcana of Avatars first lets you craft, and then manifest, an Avatar. Crafting an Avatar starts modestly expensive in Arcane, and eventually becomes very expensive, though you only need to craft a given Avatar once. Manifesting it costs the same amount, and maintaining it ties up a petty amount of mind and intellect to start, growing to a modest amount for the greatest Avatars.
        Withdrawing the invested intelligence causes an Avatar to dissipate, but by paying the Arcane cost again it may be resummoned. The range that the Arcana of Avatars may summon at is normally dependent on your Arcane State, but by buying this perk you gain the maximum range - able to summon an avatar even into another plane of existence, though you need at least some way of targeting where you want it to manifest, of which you know several methods. Normally, it's only possible to manifest a single avatar at a time.
        Most avatars are constructs, though Greater and True Avatars are living creatures. Avatars are immune to mind affecting spells. You can look through your Avatar's eyes at any time. Your avatar is completely loyal and incorruptible by any force, magical or mundane. It will work towards your goals even if it doesn't know it's an avatar or that you exist.
        You may take control of your avatar at any time, and while doing so may channel your abilities through it - casting spells, manifesting powers, and so on. Likewise you can use your skills and feats through it. The avatar may be aware of this control or explain it away as you like. You may give them orders they will follow to the best of their abilities.
        There are several different stages of avatar that you can learn to manifest sequentially.
        Rudimentary: Has no mind of its own, is very fragile, cannot channel your powers, can't speak, and can't pass for a living thing. Will be destroyed by even a light blow. You must actively control it, or it will collapse to the ground. Lesser Has the mind of a dumb child but can follow orders, but won't do anything you didn't explicitly order. Can't yet channel your powers. Might survive a single light blow. Cannot speak. Can pass as a living thing at a distance, but is cold and doesn't breath.
        Standard: Has the mind of a slow adult. Can speak, but only in your voice. It cannot attack on its own, but it is able to be a channel for your powers and skills at this point. Its flesh is warm and it breathes, though it won't sweat or bleed.
        Superior: Has the mind of an average adult and can think independently as needed. It has the health of an average human. It can contact you to get further instructions if it needs them. It can use basic skills on its own.
        Greater: Is actually a living thing, a first level character with skills and feats and the attributes of a starting adventurer, though it will never learn or grow. If you don't want it to, it won't even know it's an avatar, believing itself a real person, following your goals subconsciously.
        True: Nothing can detect that a True avatar is anything but a normal mortal. It can fall in love, have children, learn and grow, though it can't grow beyond a fourth of your own fully realized potential. Though it can be better than you at things by specializing differently.
        Once you grow able to manifest a True avatar, you'll start the cycle again with a second avatar, starting at Rudimentary and growing to True, at which point the cycle will repeat.
        Hierarchy of Souls (100CP)
        Normally an Avatar is a transitory thing - even the True Avatar. Not for you. Once you have manifested a True Avatar you will be able to separate a piece of your soul - the part that's able to manifest that Avatar, and imbue it with vast quantities of Arcane, raising that Avatar to the status of Sub-Soul.
        You lose the ability to manifest one Avatar, but in return the Sub-Soul becomes a persistent being you don't need to maintain. If it should ever be slain, it will return in a night and a day for no cost. Its potential grows, being able to become as strong as you. This is just potential, it will have to get there the hard way.
        If you let it, it can channel your powers itself - casting your memorized spells, manifesting powers from your reserves, and so on. It also counts as a Bound Phylactery. So long as it lives, you will return. You can channel spells through it as if you were present, without having to take control of it or use its actions, and observe around it, rather than just through its eyes. You always count as touching it for the purposes of spells (and it counts as 'you' for purposes for self-only spells), and can flawlessly teleport to it over any distance by the spell, or for a small cost in Arcane. You can store Arcane in it, and both you and it can draw upon that Arcane to use Arcana itself. You can hang up to six spells in it for both of your uses, and hang another six spells as contingencies. If those contingencies are attack spells, they won't harm your Sub-Soul even if they drop down on top of it.
        It retains the incorruptibility and absolute loyalty of an Avatar, and counts as a living creature or as a construct, whichever is most advantageous at any given moment.


-Talking Head (Dresden files) (300CP)
        Something between a magical computer and a lab assistant, this Spirit of Intellect would have forgotten more about magic than most wizards ever knew if it was actually capable of forgetting without being ordered to. Its personality is something between your own and how you think it should behave, which means you're probably getting something close to Bob if you're not careful. Aside from dispensing forgotten lore, they're able to possess and control things, ranging from friendly dire housecats to giant stone lions, and can even act as an emergency mystical battery if need be. Includes a free storage skull.


-Canoptek Spyder (Necron) (400CP)
        Not all troops in the Necron arsenal were once Necrontyr. The Canoptek constructs bear the distinction of being entirely robotic in nature. One of the most important of these constructs is the Canoptek Spyder, meant to oversee Necron tombs while its inhabitants sleep. To aid in this purpose, the Canoptek Spyders are able to manufacture swarms of Canoptek Scarabs and direct them towards intruders, ripping them to shreds before they even have a chance to scream. Additionally, they are capable of repairing Necrons who are damaged beyond even Necrodermis' ability to repair.


-Cu Sith (Monster Girl Encyclopedia) (400CP)
A dog that has, out of a deep wish to love and serve you in a better form, transformed into a humanoid canine Mamono.  Your pet views you as her master and can sense danger and hostility toward you.  Moreover, her breed is highly intelligent and adaptable, such that she can learn new skills to better serve you at what you need help with most.  If you want help with food, for instance, she could gradually train to be a master chef, if you need a loyal knight she can become a fierce warrior, or if you want someone to help you with sorcery, she can learn magic spells and rituals; the main requirement is that you must be there to teach her some of the steps along the way for her to fully learn. The Cu Sith is normally a dog from the setting, but if you already own a dog, you may import your dog into the role; in the case that your dog already had special attributes or training, her Cu Sith version might start out with special skills – a hunting dog might now be a full master as a gamekeeper and hunter, and a [D&D] “Blink Dog” with a natural ability to teleport might retain that ability and in fact be able to use it better than ever before.


-Delilah the Dark Elf (MCU) (400CP)
        Not everyone agreed with the homicidal views of Malekith and his horde of Dark Elves in regards to the light in the universe. A rare few such as Deliah felt that their time had come and gone, and would resign themselves to seeing what this new state of creation could offer. She's very curious as a result, and it's a good idea not to leave her alone with any technology for more than ten minutes if you don't want it disassembled and in the process of being studied. She's very meticulous at recording anything she finds though, so perhaps it might be good to let her work.


-Ex-Sovereign Taylor (MCU) (400CP)
        The Sovereign species would insist that they are perfect both physically and mentally, and that they are the pinnacle of beauty as a result. Taylor would say that's a load of hogwash coming from stagnant snobs who are too afraid to explore what true beauty is. He's an exceptionally talented geneticist, but was banished from his homeworld because he altered his genome to pursue his dream goal of becoming a Cuteness Singularity. His words. He's been studying human culture and has entire terabytes of material dedicated to his pursuit, and will gladly aid anyone who wishes to improve themselves on a genetic level to become a better version. As long as it's cute.


-Friendly Replicator Android v2 (Stargate Atlantis) (400CP)
        Once McKay (or you) gets the nanite table in Atlans working, you will find blueprints to produce a Friendly Replicator Android. FRAN v2 has a blank slate of memories and a somewhat naive and innocent personality. It can alter its own appearance and interface with the minds of other humans and Replicators (and presumably Wraith) by establishing physical contact, but can't alter her own coding. FRAN-2's default appearance can be either the same as FRAN's or to your specifications. Her systems are hardwired without the ability to self-replicate. With enough samples and the right skills the blueprints allow you to unlock further secrets of the replicators. Try not to accidentally engulf your Warehouse (or any planets) in a swarm of nanomechanical spiders


-Friends on the Other Side (Lords of the Night - Zombies) (400CP)
        Ether Zombies oftentimes are guided by strange voices, spiritual presences no one else feels or experiences. You are one of them, but the forces guiding you are clearly helping you and furthering your interests. You are just given an advantage at... everything. You pick the right door at the end of a riddle without reading the riddle. You aim for weak spots you never noticed. You react to attacks you never saw coming.
        This never gives you more than immediate knowledge, and about things happening right around you now. It can help you pick the right answer from a multiple choice question with a definite right answer, but can't tell you a friend will betray you next week. Not even if they made the choice right now, unless they are in your presence when they make that choice.
        Within these limitations, they're overwhelmingly strong. If you needed to mechanically represent this for something other than multiple choice (which you'll just always win), think of it like a +10 insight bonus on everything that makes sense for an insight bonus.
        The forces helping you are outer-planes forces. Powers that hedge them out can interfere. They also work through divination. Powers that protect against divination can also interfere. Though that interference can still say something, and they'll likely pass that on to you.


-God program (Overwatch) (400CP)
        Well now, this is extremely surprising. You've come into possession of a powerful AI bearing extremely close resemblance to those that led the first omnic crisis. This supercomputer is both fully sapient and unfalteringly loyal to you. Possessed of the most advanced hardware in this world (including what you can create), it is able to process extremely fast calculations. It also possessed the greatest ability of the God programs: the ability to infect and control other technology. If its existence becomes known, expect to deal with hostility and fear from almost everyone, human and omnic alike.


-Legacy Forger (The Gamer) (400CP)
        To be a Wuxian is to respect the concept of a Legacy, something that is handed down across the generations, gaining something with each new possessor. To be a Forger of Legacies is to be one who can craft such things, handing them down to others in the expectation that they will grow as they are used, then be handed down again, and again, and again. A Legacy can take any shape, such a sword, a staff, a cloak, or even a title. When a Legacy is made, the Forger instills in it one singular effect, attack, or technique at its most basic level, then passes it off to a Bearer. As long as the Bearer possesses the Legacy, they can use that ability, and that ability will grow and grow with usage and insight. Eventually, it will reach a point where it can grow no further (level 100 as Jee Han would say), and the Legacy should be passed on to another person. In doing so, the Old Bearer can either choose to instill a second ability (another effect, attack, or technique) into the Legacy, or to evolve the first ability. Unless the Legacy is specifically passed upwards, or there are no descendants, previous Bearers will be unable to use the Legacy. Each Legacy is typically dedicated to a unifying concept, such as a family, a nation, or an ideal.
        * Lets you give magical artifacts to organizations, capable of being adapted to new circumstances even after you have left.
        * Not useful for short term, but still a unique crafting ability, suited for its purpose


-Pixl Shaman (Paper Mario) (400CP)
Nearly three thousand years ago, a powerful magician among the Ancients created the first Pixls. He accomplished this by transferring a spirit into a vessel that he created for a specific purpose, that purpose determining the powers of the Pixl created. You have learned this ancient art and are now capable of creating Pixls of your own. Pixls are small fairy-like creatures each of which possess a unique power that could be found useful by a Hero in this world.


-Ancilla (Forerunner Saga) (450CP)
        Every personal armour comes with its own ancilla, and nearly every forerunner has their own personal armour. Ancilla are also involved in nearly every aspect of forerunner technology. The number of ancillas within the empire likely outnumber the amount of forerunners by several orders of magnitude. This is your own personal ancilla. One of the standard ancilla provided to any citizen. It is programmed to listen to you above all else. It would be stranger if you didn't have one honestly. This ancilla is at the level of a metarch ancilla.


-AI Seed | Muse AI Import (Eclipse Phase) (650CP)
        AI Seed (600CP)
        A potential Seed AI, capable of the feared exponential development curve. It is presently inert in a shoebox-sized processor array. Carefully nurtured in a simulspace and given the right interaction, information and physical resources, it is fully capable of growing into a "friendly" ASI like the Prometheans. If left to its own devices, it will grow into something resembling a pre-Fall TITAN essentially oblivious to any value a human life holds except strategically. The nascent ASI does not require a companion slot until it reaches human-level intelligence how long this takes will depend entirely on how you choose to let it develop (with no brakes and free access to hardware, it could race to human level in less than an hour). Firewall and lots of other people will not be happy if they learn you have this.
        Muse AI Import (50CP)
        Import into muse AI for 50cp to ensure loyalty of the AI, these seed AIs tend to go genocidal otherwise.


-A.I. Chip (Warlock of The Magus World) (800CP)
        The source of Leylin's strength, this chip was created in another world in another time but that no longer matters. Through metaphysical means, this chip has now fully merged with your soul and became one with your being. These are two of its primary functions: Data Storage and Analysis.
        The A.I. Chip stores everything you experience through your senses and records it down, analyzing data, gathering samples, importing and organizing your memory, running any types of simulations based on that data.
        For example, using data from a target, the A.I. chip can simulate a path to victory against that enemy, the greater the data the easier it would be. One example of a potential result would be fighting an opponent without taking any damage as well as analysing the probability of injury occurring. Estimate wind, trajectory and analysing orbital shooting, and A.R.(Augmented Reality) assist giving a nigh-100% chance to hit the target.
        With this chip Leylin was able to create potions as a master when he was just an Acolyte, optimise an ancient knight breathing technique, refine the bloodline of a Giant Kemoyin Serpent from it's descendents, a very pure bloodline equal to that of a first generation warlock, analyze different layers of the Weave allowing him to gain all spell models of each layer.
        The Chip can also scan, analyze and create spell models that would take others months in days and transfer it straight into your memory, simulating creation of your own spell models based on data analyzed.
        Scanning you and others and you will get the statistics such as Strength, Agility, Vitality, Spiritual Force, Magical Power, Current Status, Skills, Elements Affinity, Feats, Specialties. This is only an example, you can freely change how your stats are categorized, and what the number represents. If you have access to Mana, Qi, Ki, Chi, Aura, Psionic, Esoteric Energies and such, the A.I. Chip will recognize and establish records about it and for others in future worlds.
        The A.I. Chip is also able warn you against danger, when your stats changed, undesired status afflictions, act as a firewall for your mind, perform surgery on your body, expel poisons, formulate cures for curses, improve recipes, control your energies, detect energy undulations, assist in breakthroughs, can connect to and interact with both magical and scientific technology, get rid of abnormal status, scan down to the sub-atomic level and observe antimatter, controlling your clones, etc.
        The A.I. Chip's capabilities improve as you and your soul grow stronger, those mentioned here are just PART of what the chip is capable of.
        Your chip starts out with the processing power of 10 supercomputers, enough to turn 10 years of research into 2 hours. It comes with a maximum scanning range of 10km. Both the A.I. Chip and its scanning ability is undetectable by any means, though it has a difficulty scanning those immensely stronger than you, and some are even able to prevent you from scanning them.
        You automatically know how to use your A.I. Chip to the best of its abilities. While a regular chip can store 10,000 years worth of memories, yours has infinite memory storage and as the A.I. Chip is bonded to your soul, everything in its memory is directly accessible to you wherever you desire it to be. Include basic scientific knowledge of Leylin's old world.
        For an extra 200 CP, your A.I. Chip is upgraded to gain all the same features at the same level of power Leylin's was at at the end of the novel, to the point that it could simulate and analyse universes and Daos of reality, and know everything there is in this verse. You still can upgrade it with the ease of a regular one, just not as much gain until you reach Rank 9/Overgod level.
        The A.I. Chip does not have any intelligence of its own, but you can import an already existing A.I. into the chip.




 --- Domain: Protection (2) (35 Perks) --- 


-Murphy's Law (SCP Foundation) (100CP)
        You've been around so many experiments, so much weird shit, that you notice things other people don't and instinctively position yourself, as a subconscious reaction to anything that can go wrong, and avoid the eventual backfire. The knowledge that a few errant bubbles in a flask can quickly turn into boiling so violently that even the open end of it isn't enough to let all of its energy out, turning it into a chemical explosive, is not lost on you. Neither is the fact that that open flask over there just bubbled when a piece of dust fell into it. If you're running the experiments, you know how to avoid those circumstances, and how to extinguish the fires if and when they break out.


-Parasite's Compromise (Monster Girl Encyclopedia) (100CP)
        It's so cruel to hate a parasite, it just wants to live like any other living thing. It's just that its survival instincts tend to create conflict with its host. However, you know how to make the experience mutually beneficial. If you are infected with a parasite, you can merge with the parasite and take control of it, thus preventing it from harming you; in fact, the parasite, having merged with you, will now often be beneficial for your body, covering defences that your body alone could not handle. You will essentially be sharing the same mind and memory (with you in charge), and since the host (you) is now bonded with the parasite, there will be no further conflict over living space or control. On the flipside, if you are in the form of a parasite and have infected a living host, you can, by gaining consent from the host or by overpowering the host's will, merge with the host, you becoming the host and the host becoming the parasite. Either way, parasite or host, you remain the dominant one in the bond. If you wish to break off the merge on either end of the spectrum, you can separate again, on condition that the parasite (even if it's you) will be automatically ejected from the host's body. Please note that the perk applies not only to physical parasitism, but also spiritual forms of parasitism such as possession (which is also pretty common here with things like Cursed Swords).


-Strategy Trance (Brockton's Celestial Forge) (100CP)
        At will you may go into a trance in which your mind speeds up, your eyes glaze over and you start to instinctively analyse your current situation, any data points about your enemies, environment, your available powers and tools and their uses. You can then use all that information to instinctively construct hypothetical scenarios of possible resolutions to the encounter. After the trance ends you will have boosted competence to follow through with any plans you made within the trance, almost as if your instincts are guiding you.
        The trace does not leave you defenceless, two things protect you during it, firstly a few external seconds of trance can be up to 10s of minutes of internal time. Secondly you will immediately wake up from the trance if you are attacked or if you would have wanted to be woken from it at any time for some other reason.
        This perk is further boosted by any other mental perks you have and synergies and integrates aspects of all your mental perks to enhance the trance in some way or another.


-SUPERHUMAN DESIRE (Medaka Box Abnormal) (100CP)
You always wanted to be special and that want was itself so strong that you really did become so. Whenever you are subjected to a procedure that will improve or beneficially alter you with a chance of injury to you, death or even just the procedure failing outright, it will instead have a guaranteed chance of success. Risky operations will always go off without a hitch, shoving an energy source into your own body will have it combine with you successfully if there was even the smallest chance of you not dying.


-Toggle (Young Justice) (100CP)
        Toggle allows its user to forgo learning to control their powers by simply allowing them to turn their powers off when they aren't needed. This can be done per power, so there isn't a need to go without the ability to teleport because you don't want to use your super strength. Also works on out of Jump powers. You can think of this like a dial. It can be on, or full power, as well as off, or no power, and anywhere in between those two states.


-Blank II (Essential Body Modification Supplement) (200CP)
        Abilities which gather information about your past, present, or future do not work on you. This includes scrying, divination, mind reading, and even cold reading and lie detection. This ability not only affects your immediate person but also provides a degree of protection to items and people around you, making it difficult to predict the past, present, or future of any group you move with or vessel you travel on. If you have the Essential Mutuality perk, your affected companions gain the full benefit of your Blank perk even if they are acting independently.
        I: You are immune to all supernatural and technological abilities and devices which perform the functions described above. You simply do not register to such abilities, though your own abilities function normally. Purely mundane skills at cold reading or lie detection will be less effective, but still function to some degree. Dsc: Sch/Ass/Arc/Sup/Lch/Bea/Dra/Exp/Hea
        II: Even mundane versions of the above items do not function against you. Furthermore, you are able to detect when someone is actively attempting to discern such information through supernatural or technological abilities or devices and feed them false information of the type they expect. Thus, you can feed an image of yourself asleep in bed to a scrying spell while you're secretly across town beating up thugs or you can have a truth detection spell return 'truth' when you are telling a lie. Note that this does not protect you from compulsions to tell the truth or share information directly. Additionally, any items which you create have a measure of this protection, making it difficult to predict actions directly relying on those items and making it impossible to detect the items themselves with most supernatural abilities.


-Fashion (Highschool of the Dead) (200CP)
        Your clothing and entire body acquire defensive properties equal to the most superior protective items you have currently equipped. Emphasis on protective item an iron or steel ring won't give you metal tough skin the minimum is things like knee pads from extreme sports, helmets even an apron would count, though all that'd do is protect you from the dangers of a kitchen


-Inertia of Self II (Essential Body Modification Supplement) (200CP)
        You are protected against effects that would affect your mind and existence.
        I: You are immune to any effect that would affect your memories. If someone turns back time, alters reality, or attempts to directly alter your memories, you retain both the 'original' and 'new' memories, instinctively knowing which set is which. Other than your two sets of memories, this perk does nothing to tell you who changed things or even what they specifically changed if it isn't otherwise obvious.
        II: You are immune to any effect that would alter or outright destroy your body or existence. This protection extends to conceptual, temporal, and reality warping effects that work either directly or indirectly to destroy or alter you. This would prevent a time traveler from killing you as a baby or causing an accident that would leave present-you paralyzed. It would not protect you from a fireball created through temporal manipulation or having a time traveler frame you for a crime that lands you in prison.


-Juggernaut (Terraria) (200CP)
        Your armor is a lot more effective at doing what it does just by the sheer virtue of it being latched onto and wrapped around your fleshy bits. Not to get too far into the math of it, your armor is about half-again more effective than it would be otherwise.


-Mental Resistance III (Essential Body Modification Supplement) (200CP)
        Your mind and will are strong.
        I: You are very difficult to intimidate and have a high resistance to mental fatigue (such as from extended warfare or study) and can generally delay dealing with mental trauma until any immediate crisis is dealt with. Also, you do not get bored with tasks easily and can study or practice abilities for extended periods without penalty or need for a break.
        II: Immunity to the items in tier I plus a high degree of resistance to memetic hazards, insanity,mind control, and other factors that would impact how your mind works.
        III: Complete immunity to the items in tiers I and II.


-Professor Guinea Pig (Ben 10 0.1) (200CP)
        You have successfully managed to transplant your own brain into a jar now attached to your body! How?...I...I don't actually know. Regardless, you have the ability to use your own body and mind as a guinea pig with you as a one-man science team, even if it would normally be improbable or downright impossible. Replace both your arms with robotic copies at the same time, shove organs into robotic vessels and armor, and so on. All by yourself. Don't think about it too hard.


-Prototype Process (Ben 10 0.1) (200CP)
        Science is a learning process and sometimes that learning process involves explosions, malfunctions, or idiots messing with things they shouldn't. Well, they used to, anyways. When technology you've built or used would normally suffer a malfunction or an experiment would become a disaster, it will instead create a harmless inconvenience instead of blowing up in your face. A device's sensitive power core being struck would see it shut down immediately, a DNA serum you inject into yourself gives you mild indigestion instead of mutating you into a horrible monster, and so on. If a result would be entirely negative for you, the impact is dulled to a comical accident instead of something that could endanger your life and those of others. How lucky for you.


-Safety First (Cardcaptor Sakura) (200CP)
        You can choose to be completely unaffected by your own magic when it suits you, including beings that were created by you or spells taught to others that you designed.


-Things best not known (Smash Up-Obligatory Cthulhu Supplement) (200CP)
        You don't go mad from cosmic truths, but have a sense for when such secrets are dangerous to others. You are good at explaining things away besides. Best not to spread the madness around.


-Wavestrength (NieR Automata) (200CP)
        The signal is clear and strong. You wouldn't be able to do your job if you couldn't connect to your girls in the field so thankfully you never experience issues with your connections. As long as your targets are in range, your broadcasts cannot be blocked, intercepted, hacked or otherwise interfered with. Even when you should be prevented from sending out anything at all, as long as you have something that can broadcast, it will broadcast. At perfect quality on both ends as well, ensuring that any signal that comes to you will be received without interference as well, at least when from your allies.


-Brain in the Butt (Donkey Kong Country) (300CP)
        You can transfer the location of your internal organs and other bodily systems such as your brain to other places within your body. And it won't disrupt your normal bodily functions (unlike a certain croc who went from psychopath to dimwit when his brain slipped down to his tail).


-Concept Ball (Medaka Box Abnormal) (400CP)
        When two combatants reach a certain level of power, fighting becomes a bit pointless. When both of you are Immovable Objects and Unstoppable Forces, you're just going to be pointlessly nudging against each other. Well, if you were equal you would be. But you're Not Equal. Whenever your own abilities that are meant to be without peer come into conflict with another such ability, yours trumps theirs. A blow that can pierce anything will tear through a defence that can block anything when you are using it. Your absolutes are more so, simply for the fact that you are the one using them.


-Context Problem (Ben 10 0.1) (400CP)
        Magic comes from mana, or maybe it doesn't. It could just be life energy that makes using it easier. Maybe it's just really advanced science? Or is science really advanced magic? For some reason, your foes and onlookers have trouble nailing down what your abilities are and how they actually work. Instead of using things like context clues and experiences, they will assume it's something that makes sense to their world instead of leaping to 'otherworldly invader', and almost always in a way that gives you an advantage over them. It might be years before someone actually realizes how your special abilities actually work, let alone any weaknesses. Suckers!


-Environmental Tolerance IV (Essential Body Modification Supplement) (400CP)
        You are not damaged by hazardous environments, though this does not provide you a method of propulsion.
        I: You no longer need to breathe and do not suffer from temperatures between -100C and +100C (-150F to +200F). You are immune to most radiation (up to about 1,000 mSv; the amount experienced during unshielded exposure to space).
        II: As tier I, plus you do not suffer from temperatures below 1500C (+2700F) or the effects of pressure lower than 1000 atmospheres (including the effects of vacuum). You are immune to the effects of radiation at all levels.
        III: As tier II, but the protection extends to any non-magical environmental source.
        IV: As tier III, but the protection extends to magical environments such as energy planes.


-Failsafe (Supergod) (400CP)
        It might be worth just taking a step back from this all. This superhuman arms race, is it really all a good idea? I guess not. You may not have the power to stop your country from foolishly creating a weapon of mass destruction but with this, you'll at least be able to stop that weapon from being the thing to destroy you all straight away. Your experiments and efforts at crafting or creating something never backfire on you. When they fail, be it a self-destruction or turning against you, they will instead shudder to a stop and deactivate harmlessly. You won't automatically know what caused them to go wrong, though you can probably find out with some effort, but with this no process or invention you make and are in the control of will end in your harm or death. Others can still be harmed a plenty though, so long as it wouldn't harm or endanger you as well.


-Harmony (Generic First Jump) (400CP)
        Sometimes, the things you are collecting will clash with each other or are difficult to use together. That is no longer the case. You could safely use both the Dark and Light sides of the Force, channel both divine and demonic energies, wield conflicting forms of magic or energy, mix radically different technologies or biologies, even keep your entire harem in one place, and they will all get along with each other. They will get along with you as well. None of your abilities, possessions, Companions or anything else that belongs to you in some way will be able to harm, corrupt, or alter you against your will.


-Loading Human.exe (Generic Worm Fanfiction lll) (400CP)
        You can turn off your emotions at will. This makes it easier to make logical decisions but you have trouble understanding others while they're off. You won't get stuck with them off because turning them back on would be illogical or anything like that. Oh, and you get along famously with robots and AI. You really get them.


-LOCKED ROOMS (The Culture Minds) (400CP)
        Your mind can be compartmentalized to a variety of ends. You could shunt data to a locked room in your mind, one which memetic effects, viruses, or corrupted data cannot escape. Or just block off certain knowledge until the time is right for you to access it. These locked rooms cannot be read by mind-reading methods unless you willingly open them. You can even lock a compartment of your mind and figuratively throw away the key, keeping it sealed even from yourself until some condition is met. They will also be able to contain any interlopers, memetics or unusual effects that stray into your mind from other sources, digital or not, though you should act fast so as to avoid locking away the majority of your mind.


-Not This Again (Girl's Frontline) (400CP)
        You know how mad scientists never seem to learn from their mistakes? Like, when their colleague discovers the secret to a more powerful AI, but the coding makes commands like Protect the factory from intruders basically orders for genocide? Luckily, you're much better at learning from your mistakes or others'; the more immediate your contact with said screw-up, the less likely you are to repeat it even accidentally. This can be trained like any other skill; with time, you can train yourself to do just about anything your body is capable of to near-zero margins of error, although progress tends to slow down when you reach the half-way mark.


-Phylactery (Monster Girl Encyclopedia) (400CP)
        An item used by Liches to serve as the vessel for their soul. From the soul, you can remotely control your body and see through it. Since the phylactery keeps your soul separate from your body, your mind remains unaffected by hormones, spirit energy, pain, and other sensations that would normally disrupt your concentration. If the phylactery is damaged, your soul will automatically return to your body.


-Renewal (Age of Wonders ll) (400CP)
        Wounds can be mended, cities can be rebuilt. Even the lands tainted by death magics or burnt by fire can be restored, seeded with crops and forests until life flourishes anew. Life magic embodies this ideal, holding the power to endure, to undo all harms and ease all woes. Your spells and abilities are infused with this power, and it is impossible to corrupt or twist them against their purpose. Furthermore, although your magics are now more difficult to suppress or destroy, if your enchantments are only partially broken they will slowly restore themselves to their full potential, their own magical natures healing as surely as more physical wounds.


-Safe Self Modification (SB Dragonball Z) (400CP)
        Putting your brain inside a jar so you can transfer it into a robot body may not seem like the smartest thing to others. However, they don't know that you have the peculiar ability to always succeed in your self-modifications. The chances of things going wrong with the procedure are simply zero. As long as the technology behind it is solid, then malfunctions, complications in surgery, and other accidents like that just don't happen. In addition, none of the modifications you make will ever be incompatible, or conflict with each other. Want to use gene therapy on your robot body? That somehow works.


-THEY ARE MINE AND MINE ALONE (Medaka Box Abnormal) (400CP)
        Perhaps you can no longer lose your powers due to your own growing up but it's still possible for people to take them away from you by force. Or at least it was before you made it known how much you refuse to let go of what you consider yours. It's impossible to degrade or take away your abilities in any shape or form, even on a merely temporary basis. Attempts to weaken, nullify, disable, steal, destroy or do any other sort of negative thing to your powers or the energies that they run on will find themselves not even touching you. It seems like your powers really are too integral to your being to ever be taken away from you.


-BETTER GO READ MY OWN MANUAL (The Culture Minds) (600CP)
        You have mental libraries of everything you are, what you carry and what you can do. If you need to know if or how you can do something that is within your capabilities, the information is there. This information covers your belongings, inventory and personal equipment as well, updating in real time. It is most useful for configuring yourself or your assets to carry out a task you haven't personally done before, but this detailed manual also holds the sum of the technology that makes up your body, allowing you to fully repair, rearm or fully construct a new from first principles all the technology that your body has incorporated within it. It does not, unfortunately, provide information on things you know nothing about, or things that are just so bizarre that nobody has considered them, but may contain theoretical notes. Very theoretical notes. Carrying out those never-considered options lies in your hands.


-By the grace of the Machine God (Adeptus Mechanicus) (600CP)
        By His blessing, let the machine be sanctified. With ritual and prayer, protect His works from corruption and witchery. Raise a bulwark of iron anointed with sacred oil and incense and safeguarded its form and functions from eldritch powers. Be their origin within the material or immaterial, powers that attempt to twist the form or control the functions of your machines will be repulsed. Minor hexes and vexes will be repelled with contemptuous ease, while mightier powers must devote a great deal of power and concentration to overcome this protection. Even then, they will struggle to do so.


-Limits? (Generic Worm Fanfiction) (600CP)
        So powers are supposed to be limited aren't they? Depends on the fanfic, really. Either way, yours aren't. No, this doesn't double your powers every six months. That'd be crazy. What this does is smash every glass ceiling, barrier or restriction into so much dust. Any and all of your powers, abilities, skills etc., are like muscles for you now, only growing stronger the more you exercise them. This does nothing for your rate, at least by itself, but it means that regardless of how they're supposed to operate, any and all of your powers can now be trained up infinitely. Furthermore, no power or skill you have can ever harm you directly, unless it's someone else using it on you. Nor, for that matter, can anything you do to improve yourself. Too much, at least. Training too much till you break half your muscles will still put you in the hospital, but what would be a lifelong crippling for others would only be a temporary thing for you, and you'd still benefit fully. You can use and develop mutually exclusive or opposite powers without any harm, and similarly use any and all powers you have without fear of ruining your own body or mind or whatever. No amount of overusing your powers can hurt you or them permanently. Again, you might suffer for a while, but it'll only ever be temporary and they'd grow that much stronger for it.


-Luck Forgives All Sins (Warhammer 40k: Tau Empire) (600CP)
        Developing AI without instigating a rebellion. Fiddling with Warp travel without Gellar fields. Messing with biological manipulation and nanotechnology without creating a homogenizing swarm. While you or those under you work to push technology forward, you will somehow stumble your way around or past the major drawbacks and potential disasters you could invite, whether you know they are there or not. This won't let you ignore those threats, but will push you to solutions that don't trigger them, such as skimming the warp instead of entering it, even if this results in inferior results. Unless you know about a threat and deliberately work in such a way as to trigger it (such as trying to form grey goo), your luck will hold.


-Removed From Context (Young Justice) (600CP)
        Being from outside of this world makes it much harder for others to predict what you're doing or planning at any given time, making you harder to counter in a fight as well as harder to plan against. In addition, it's impossible to replicate your powers and technology that aren't native to whatever world you're in. If you willingly choose to share or give your technology, then it may be replicated.


-ROOT OF ALL GENIUS (Medaka Box Abnormal) (600CP)
        The greatest minds of our world didn't make their great discoveries when they lived happy, peaceful lives. They made them in times of war, after living through hell themselves. Or at least that's the view of a certain young genius. The worse the situation you find yourself in or the more miserable you are on a personal level, the better you and your powers will get. A little constant annoyance won't make much discernable difference but constantly subjecting yourself to tortures and poisons and purposefully ruining your relationships with those you love, all the while reaching the climax of the villain's evil plan, and you could dwarf your original power, so long as you kept yourself in that situation.


-Accentuate the Positive | Eliminate the Negative (Limitless) (900CP)
        Accentuate the Positive (400CP)
        You now have an immunity to side effects of a certain kind. A super cool sword that takes over the body of its wielder? It's not getting even an inch inside of you. A demon making a pact with you for powers? Well, he is inside of your soul, but he's now stuck, only able to fuel your new abilities like a glorified battery. This perk only protects you against sources of power from outside of your body, including combat drugs, artifacts, enchantments, magical pacts, items and other things you wield by giving you only the beneficial parts and leaving the rest behind. This comes with complete immunity to addiction.
        Eliminate the Negative (500CP)
        Now the immunity to side effects can affect internal things. Magic that may have drawn on your emotions to fuel its power now has a separate pool. Any drawbacks your powers, biological traits or magic systems may have held have been wiped away.


--- Domain: Time (3) (47 Perks) --- 




-Pocket Watch (Wonderland No More) (50CP)
        An ornate silver watch with an hourglass engraved upon its casing. If you wind back the watch, you will gain enhanced speed/quickness until the watch finishes unwinding or an hour has passed. You can also immediately stop the watch's effect by snapping its case shut.


-Rapid Construction (Blazing Saddles) (50CP)
        You are not only a truly excellent carpenter, you are an exceptionally fast worker. Any form of construction or crafting will be completed in a tenth the time it would otherwise take, though your overall quality will suffer if you use this at full effect (times ten). At times two, you'll sacrifice none of the quality, but as you get closer to times ten, you'll sacrifice more and more of it.


-ACCIDENTALLY DROPPED MY GRAVITAS (The Culture Minds) (100CP)
        It's terribly serious business being a Ship, Mind or Hub, isn't it? Being responsible for your passengers, having to take care of Big Mind Business, handling all kinds of Ship-related emergencies that need reaction times down to the microsecond. Yet sometimes it's the simple things that make existence worth experiencing. You can always find time to really enjoy your hobbies or celebrations, no matter how trivial they might seem, and the weight of the responsibility on your shoulders can't crush your joyful and pleasant mood if you chose to have one. You can also drop into a whimsical, almost nonsensical persona at the drop of a hat, all the better to annoy much more serious people and Minds.


-Don't Need A Team (Ace Combat) (100CP)
        Fighter planes are pretty complicated machines, and more often than not you need a whole crew to maintain them so that they don't break down in the middle of a fight and doom the pilot. You know your plane well enough to circumvent this issue. You've got just the right idea on what needs tuning up and what needs fixing, along with having the speed to be able to fix a plane up by yourself without the need for a crew in a fraction of the time. Performance issues are a thing of the past for you.


-Fixer (Smash Up) (100CP)
        You're really good. All your repairs seem to take half as much time as normal. A true miracle worker.


-I Can Whip Something Up (My Life As A Teenage Robot) (100CP)
        Working late nights and filling out strange requests is just another Tuesday for a Scientist of your calibre. This perk ensures that you'll never suffer burnout, grow overly bored, lose inspiration, or have your work suffer because of exhaustion. So long as your basic needs are at least barely being met you can keep happily churning out work day after day.


-Simple Scientific Solution (Tenchi Muyo!) (100CP)
        This perk grants two features that in universe depend on your setting, out of universe both work unless you desire otherwise.
        Slice of Life: Science solves everything, even the little household problems. You can create supertech improvements to common tools and appliances, up to and including automobiles or similar works of engineering. Create dishwashers that can clean dishes in an instant, self heating plumbing or forcefield window panes that act as air conditioners.
        SpaceOpera: Well established methodologies and an instinctive grasp of the same allow you to draw conclusions or produce results incredibly fast. You halve the time it takes to gather data, compose research on some subject, or devise a test to prove/disprove something handy for when you have to figure out an enemy fortresses' one weakness


-Spark Of Genius (Galactic Civilisations II) (100CP)
        With the sheer amount and complexity of information involved in next-generation research, most scientific advances slowly progress in vast, city-sized research facilities. But every so often, there's a giant leap forward - a sudden flash of insight that ignores all perceived barriers to scientific advancement and leads to more progress in a few days than you might have otherwise seen in months. Now, you and your people are gifted with just this kind of creativity, experiencing the same kind of sudden technological breakthroughs on rare occasions. This might just make scientific progress a bit more difficult to predict in advance, but you'll always be pleasantly surprised when it happens.


-Brute Forcing Science (Hive Queen Quest) (200CP)
        Science is an amazing thing, it is what brings a being from the caves to the stars and allows them to step beyond the bounds of what nature provides. However science is a never-ending road and the more you learn the more questions you have. Researching a problem takes time, lots of time, and lots of resources. Maybe you wish to take a little shortcut through this process? With the proper handling a well versed team of scientists can do far more than a horde of idiots any day, unfortunately you may not have access to well-trained help. Taking this allows you to get around that little problem, by throwing more people at a project you can actually increase the rate at which you learn and understand things making it much easier for your research to pay off. This quickly hits a limit though and more than 200 people working on a project will probably not net you much more of an increase than 100 (which will already increase your researching skills by a large amount) Obviously quality is better than quantity but sometimes quantity has a quality all of its own.


-Dedicated Research (Stellaris) (200CP)
        As a scientist, research is your blood and bone, it is what you do every single day that you work, it is your lifeblood, your passion! So obviously it would be a shame if this passion of yours was interrupted by something such as lack of sleep, or lack of nutrition. Now while researching none of those things will affect your performance allowing you to work at your peak for several days in a row. You may pass out later however.


-Fast Service (Warhammer 40k - Squats) (200CP)
        Some might wonder what place a mechanic has on the battlefield, but they clearly never saw a tank take a crippling hit. Fortunately, your skills are such that you can repair many vehicles and devices that would seem at first glance only good for parts, and in a fifth the normal time.


-Insightful (Galactic Civilisations II) (200CP)
        Science is, ultimately, the process by which the underlying rules of reality are determined, clarified, and understood. It should not be a surprise, then, that your people's talents at logic, analysis and experimentation provide a noticeable boon to the speed of your R&D efforts? Even better, your followers are highly adept at recognizing dead ends and false results - be they positive or negative. Consequently, your faction won't waste as much time and resources on scientific endeavors that eventually turn out to be 'duds', reducing overall costs of your research as well.


-Machinist (Gargoyles) (200CP)
        You are an expert mechanic. You can rebuild and improve a helicopter in 12 hours or create a functional motorcycle from spare parts. If honed, this ability will let you make nearly anything from incredibly advanced robots to nanite swarms in only a few months time.


-Schematics to Time (Generic Video Game Developer) (200CP)
        Wasted time is a serious problem for just about any company. And while most managers might think it's because John took an extra 5 minutes for lunch, the real time sink is the direction a project ends up going, as sometimes you go down a rabbit hole trying to fix a problem and take a while to get on the right track, such as looking for a bug in the wrong part of the code. But for you, it's different. For you, every time you settle down to work you get on the right track. From looking for bugs in the right section of code to researching the right function for a problem, your work is now more of a straight line, taking no detours and going down no rabbit holes. If you have a problem, you'll always start in the right place.


-Short Development Time (Generic Video Game Developer) (200CP)
        Working at a smaller game company means that sometimes you get contracted out by a bigger corporation to make a game, and they want it ASAP. Well, at least now you can work fast enough to keep up with the deadlines. Usually, anyway. Either way, expect to do half again as much work as you would normally get done in the same span of time, all without losing any quality to your work!


-Slacking Off (Generic Factory) (200CP)
        You will always find some time where you can slack off while working without harming your performance. This doesn't actually reduce the amount of time you need to be at work, just the amount of time you need to be doing work.


-Time Flies (Lords Of The Night Zombies) (200CP)
        There are many talented old wizards who have devoted decades of work to achieving immortality, and they didn't even start that search until they were already skilled and experienced in their magic. And many of them fall short. You have a single decade. Good thing you can make the most of your time.
        Any kind of extended work or project you're working on progresses unnaturally fast. Or at least, your contribution does. Specifically, it goes five times as fast. You can read a book five times as fast, set-up a ritual five times as fast, craft five times as fast, study or do research five times as fast, and so on.
        This never works on action or dynamic set pieces. You could do five days of ritual work in a single day, but the high point at the end of the ritual, the part that must not be interrupted lest horrible consequences befall everyone? Normal time.


-Time to Cook (Wonderland No More) (200CP)
        Wonderland's sense of time is kind of screwy, and it's perfectly reasonable for a chef to go out for a midnight quest to a mountain for an egg and get back before the pot boils over. This perk essentially slows down the progression of time from a narrative standpoint as long as you are focusing on making food that includes everything from acquiring ingredients to preparing the food to setting the table. This does not slow or freeze the movements of those around you, but it basically means that as long as you are focused on cooking, you'll finish everything on time and nothing will interrupt you. For instance, if you are cooking a special potion to boost your troops in time to stop an invasion, you'll get the potion ready on time even if the siege was just an hour away. When you stop doing food-related things, time returns to its normal pace; spell preparations technically count as cooking by Wonderland rules, though.


-What's An Engineer? (Brutal Legend) (200CP)
        A guy who builds stuff, and now, so do you. Set up and tear down infrastructure in half the time, leaving you with time to rehearse your set, or whatever you'll do with that free time.


-Whittling Away the Time (Golden Sky Stories) (200CP)
Time seems to fly whenever you’re having fun doesn’t it? One moment it seems like you just started, and the next it’s already over. To be honest, it seems that the older you get – or rather, the more experienced you get – the quicker everything seems to move along.
For a brief period of time, you can accelerate any actions you are performing, whether it is casting a spell, or just reading a book. This extends to even group activities as well, affecting all of your allies involved.


-Workaholic (Sonic the Hedgehog) (300CP)
        Sometimes you wonder how some geniuses are able to build entire armadas within days or weeks of their last defeat. You become a walking factory of production. Building in masse is something that comes without issue to you. That one bot that took a week to build? Now that one bot is now 5. Or roughly 3x the size it was before. How do you even have the resources to build so much you say? The hell if I know.


-Arsenal Of Destruction (Galactic Civilisations II) (400CP)
        To build a fleet capable of defending your empire (or conquering a rival's) is not a trivial task. Parts and resources need to be brought in from dozens of industrial sectors, crews and soldiers need to be trained, and there's always the dilemma of what exactly you'll go for - larger numbers of small combat craft, or a few, powerful warships to dominate one sector at a time. Or at least it used to be. Streamlining your industrial capacity is not easy, but when it comes to military-industrial power your people are nothing short of savants. You'll be able to build more ships, faster and cheaper than before and most amazingly, this effect becomes more pronounced the greater your production target's overall size, complexity, and cost are. Heavy Fighters' small size means they don't have that many ways to optimize production, but Frigates are already substantially easier, and Dreadnaughts? Well, by the time you're building those behemoths you shouldn't be surprised if you start getting almost twice as much bang for your buck. Possibly literally, if you like using missile weapons.


-High Speed Creationist (The Weakness Of Beatrice) (400CP)
        There's no reason to bother with hours or days of waiting around for a potion to be ready, especially not when you're in the deep labyrinth, monsters are bearing down on you and your allies are injured. You've got no time for it and thus waste none, as your crafting and mixing abilities work at an insane pace. You can mix potions in seconds that take hours normally, even turning enemies into potions as you fight them if you're using the right sort of potion recipe. The way you smith or build items is just as fast, finishing swords in minutes or whole houses in hours. Combat crafting might have been seen as impossible but you're about to prove everyone wrong.


-I Know What We're Going To Do Today (Phineas and Ferb) (400CP)
        24 hours just doesn't seem like enough time to get stuff accomplished, but you'd be surprised what determination (and this perk) can get you. You can now complete days and even weeks worth of work in just a few hours, and this effect increases tremendously when you have a few helpers, to the point where a small team can work with you to complete years worth of work in a simple afternoon.


-Into The Future (Galactic Civilisations II) (400CP)
        Know where you're going - or you'll just get lost. Science has a vast spectrum of possibilities open to a society, from advanced construction methods and ecological engineering to weapons technologies and faster FTL drives. It's enough to make one's head spin - but your people know how to stay grounded, possessing a nearly prescient ability to determine how useful any particular scientific effort is going to be, how long it might take before it starts to offer tangible results, and even what further options it might lead to. This doesn't eliminate the need to figure out what the options are to begin with, and you might still have to choose between developing a better Hyperwarp or pursuing Discovery Spheres instead - but you'll at least be able to make an informed decision on which path to pursue.


-Magical Assembly (Generic Builder) (400CP)
        Rather than use tools for your building, you've learned how to assemble and disassemble things using magic. This increases your Building speed by half again.


-Manufacturing Line (Valkyria Chronicles) (400CP)
        You've always been of the opinion that technology advanced too slowly before you arrived, but now you can apply that to the physical world as well! Any building process you oversee, whether it be the forging of a sword or an entire tank factory, will now produce results twice as fast and with half the required materials used.


-One-Man Industry (God Catching Meister) (400CP)
        Despite being chained to the forge for hours on end, alchemists can make just a handful of works per day. Mixing, forging and enchanting take time and finesse, after all. Those who make items in masse tend to vomit works of low quality. In face of that, you trained and mastered the art of making things really quick without a loss in quality. About ten times as faster as your peers, in fact. While an alchemist with your same rank would take an hour to make a fire sword, you in the same span of time can make ten, and even give each different powers. This bleeds out to other aspects in your life. Time is money, after all.


-Rapid Engineering (Honor Harrington) (400CP)
        When it comes to technology, quality may beat quantity, but quantity has a quality of its own. A quality you well understand. You have a deep knowledge and skill at building shipyards and support systems, not to mention ships and their weapons, that focuses on building a lot of them very quickly, instead of building them to be the best in the world. Your product may not be the most lethal or best defended or longest sensing in the galaxy, but you know how to churn out entire fleets of the stuff in the time it would take others to make a prototype.


-Researcher (Age of Mythology) (400CP)
        You are far faster at designing and discovering new technologies. Inspiration and breakthroughs hit you far more often.


-Savvy Sultan (Macross) (400CP)
        When people think of building things, they think of you. Provided you had the resources and the understanding of the technology, you could construct all manners of machines in a fourth of the time it would normally take. By yourself. You're no slouch with any of your tools either, wielding them with the precision of a machine with no loss of speed. Quality and a deadline? No problem.


-Under Pressure (Stargate Atlantis) (400CP)
        Work that would take a whole team a week to do, you can do by yourself in a day...when you're properly motivated. Unfortunately that proper motivation involves imminent demise: a gun held to your head, an incoming blast of solar radiation, anything that would wipe you or your friends out. The closer your death approaches, the faster and better you work just keep in mind that some tasks are too large for even your accelerated competency to complete.


-Unravelling (Medaka Box Abnormal) (400CP)
        Sprinting is great and all, really, but it's not much use in life. How often is raw speed in that sense going to help, in anything from typing to fighting? But it looks like it's actually quite fitting for you. The faster you become in raw movement speed, the faster you are able to do any task at all. Becoming able to move faster than the speed of sound would let you accomplish hours of work in just minutes, with no loss in quality, consideration or effective time spent on the project. You'll be moving and acting faster but be just as effective as if you took as much time as you normally would on the task you're working on.


-Build Rome (Gundam - After Colony) (600CP)
        You have a thing about building things-you're damn fast, and you're damn good. They say you can't build 10 Mobile Suits in a week? Hah! You'll build twice that much and you'll build them to last! You simply have utter talent in the way of making things quickly-enough to double production, maybe even triple production if you work at it enough, and they'll come out with no loss of quality. In addition, these constructions will last-barring sudden disaster and similar, they'll easily last several decades of constant abuse, and if they're upkept and repaired they could even last centuries with no troubles.


-Clock of Ages (Chronicles of Narnia) (600CP)
        An enormous mechanical clock attached to your Cosmic Warehouse. By precisely adjusting various gears and chains within this clock, you can control the rate that time flows in your warehouse relative to the world outside, to a maximum of twice as fast and a minimum of half as fast. For each Jump you've completed, increase this cap by 20%. After 5 jumps, you'll be able to speed things up to three times as fast or slow them down to 1/3. After 10 jumps, you'll be able to speed things up to four times as fast, and so on. If you've got any similar pocket dimensions, you might figure out a way to hook them up to the clock as well.


-Deus Vult (Youjo Senki - Saga of Tanya the Evil) (600CP)
        The creation of cutting edge technology is an odd process. Normally, it would be long hours of research and testing followed by tiny advances. You on the other hand, by some method, have been inspired. Your specialty lies in completely eschewing the normal methods in order to create prototype technology that far outpaces everything - in exchange for vast amounts of instability. If you manage to reign in your genius, and ego, creating something halfway between genius and the status quo will leave you with something more powerful, but also easier to mass produce.


-Fast-Charging (Heat Signature) (600CP)
        Your rechargeable equipment recharges 225 times as fast. 24 hour recharge times become 16 seconds. This effects cell phones, laptops, etc. but it doesn't give them a self-powering source. Objects cannot benefit from this while in active use (A laptop in sleep mode is not in active use, but is when mining bitcoin).


-Gadgeteer (Totally Spies Martin Mystery) (600CP)
        Not only do you have the knowledge and resources to produce all of WOOHP and the Center's gadgets quickly and efficiently, but you'll never run out of ideas for new gadgets, and you'll be able to incorporate any other technologies you know seamlessly.


-Goibnu (Irish Mythology) (600CP)
        The greatest of the Tuatha smiths, Goibnu could create a spearhead with three strikes of his hammer, and it would be so sharp the man it cut would surely bleed to death. Like this legendary smith, you can forge or assemble anything you've the materials for, no matter how complex or intricate, in moments and whatever you forge shall be of mythic quality, whether armor lighter than cloth and harder than a mountain or plows that can turn over ten acres with one pass. Truly you are worthy to be called the smith of the gods.


-One-Man Assembly Line (XCOM) (600CP)
        You really liked playing with building blocks as a kid. Now that you're all grown up, the world is your playground. Your knowledge of construction and engineering is unprecedented, and making a jet engine from spare parts over a weekend is your idea of fun.


-SCP-2400 (SCP Foundation) (600CP)
        Wow, really? Alright, well, I guess you have an eye for the good stuff, then, even if it is just a chunk of concrete with a door on it. Inside this door is a blank, featureless, white expanse with no apparent limit, or defined edges, with unidentifiable, indestructible white, "ground," an atmosphere consistent with the terrestrial location of the object, and a star stuck at what appears to be twelve noon. When the door's open, time flows normally; when it's closed, however, time inside flows at one hundred and forty(140) seconds inside per second outside. The icing on the cake? There's no downside, aside from accelerated aging, and that doesn't affect you, now does it.


-Seed of The Singularity (Generic Cyberpunk) (600CP)
        They say that the future begins with an idea, but that's not true. It begins when you make an idea reality. You're not just someone that is content to fiddle the technology that's already there, you're one of the minds that could shatter everything we thought we knew. Your ability to innovate and invent is awe inspiring, doing the work of years in scant months. What you piece together in your lab to test a concept would count as a production model to anyone else, and your actual finalized designs are nothing short of pure brilliance. This applies just as well to actual discovery, burning through fields of testing and examination with incredible speed. Your work alone could build the entire future if you had the resources, and if you can survive the people who would kill for the things you can make.


-Silken Mountainriver Diagram (Talisman Emperor Mortal Dimension) (600CP)
        This Immortal Artifact takes the form of a painting 52 picturing a verdant landscape with majestic mountains and rivers so lifelike that they appear to move. With a small amount of essence, a cultivator can enter the painting which expands to the size of a world. Time flows more swiftly inside the painting, allowing a year to pass when the outside world only experiences a single day. While plants and animals grow older accordingly, sapient beings still only age a single day, making it ideal for cultivation. The owner of the Silken Mountainriver Diagram can control who enters it, but cannot directly force them to exit it. Anything which can become an attachment to your Warehouse can instead be placed inside the Silken Mountainriver Diagram.


-Steel Driving Man (Generic Factory) (600CP)
        Whenever you are working with a machine you find that you can always keep up with it, you can practically run an entire assembly line all on your own and still find time for a smoke break.
        * Scales indefinitely allowing any machinery that can be operated to benefit from perks that improve use of tools.


-Freak of Nature: Formation Specialization (Desolate Era Part I - The Three Realms) (800CP)
        The Three Realms, despite being a backwater to others in the Primordial Chaos, are filled with people that would be considered utter monsters by any outsiders. People who manage to rise above their sub-par cultivation methods and produce monsters on the level of Houyi, Ji Ning, Nuwa, Subhuti, Tathagata, Suiren, Shennong, and Fuxi, all of whom would absolutely be feared for their genius. Of course, you are no different, being an absolute freak of nature in the arts of cultivation and understanding of the dao. Getting to the level of mastering a Grand Dao would take you maybe thirty years or so, and becoming an Elder God would take you maybe twenty thousand years through sheer brute force. Hell, even becoming a World level expert would be an inevitability rather than a mere possibility, though the time it would take you could vary widely. And that's without any specializations. You may pick one aspect of Cultivation such as Heartforce, Sword Arts, or Spacetime Techniques, in which you absolutely excel, to the point where it would allow you to fight others one level higher than you, and train in it at an absolutely astonishing pace, reminiscent to Ji Ning's progress in the Sword Arts. For an extra 400 CP, undiscounted, you can pick up one more specialization. You may purchase as many specializations as you wish.


-The Man who understood Infinity (Desolate Era Part II - The Chaosverse) (800CP)
        One such as you who has a shocking and unseen talent can feel forced into a single path, the one you are best at. But you did not become the greatest in the Three Realms simply for the sake of being another specialist. No, you're a Genius, with a capital G. Whatever you find your most interesting specialization, you can uplift other side projects to train just as fast. There is one caveat however, that being that this can only be applied to five specialties at a time, though you can switch between them with little to no fanfare. If you're a master of the sword but have a deep admiration for Spacetime, there's no need to worry about talent anymore, you'll have enough to get to speed.


-We Need Reserves | Special Attention (Gundam - Advanced Generation) (800CP)
        We Need Reserves (400CP)
        When you're fighting a war, you know what you need-you need troops, you need squadrons; you need a fully-armed army. You can't fight a war without numbers, and so you can modify designs to give you just that-numbers. Your MS production capability will multiply to near 4x levels, with only a negligible decrease in quality. You can also, with time and patience, apply this design philosophy to other products.
        Special Attention (400CP)
        When you're fighting a war, you know what you need-you need guardians, you need shields; you need a well-armed force. You can't fight a war with a thousand scratches, and so you can modify designs to increase individual performance and quality-the biggest boon is that this only negligibly increases production times or costs, at the benefit of having much higher quality Mobile Suits. And you can apply this to other designs as well, with time.


--- Domain: Vehicles (4) (34 Perks) --- 


-Aerospace Engineering Makes Things Go Fast (Kerbal Space Program) (100CP)
        You have an intuitive grasp on the mechanics of wind-flow, material sciences, atmospheric drag, tensile strengths, rocketry, so on and so forth, and how it applies to the art of designing vehicles that traverse the sky and space.


-Black Thumb (Mad Max Gauntlet) (100CP)
        You have the skills of an expert mechanic, able to keep vehicles running even in the most inhospitable conditions. Repairing and tuning up engines is your bread and butter, even while they're still operating. You also have a feel for how to upgrade cars in more esoteric ways; hey, it takes skill to add that many spikes and not hurt the handling!


-Garage (Fast and Furious) (100CP)
        You have a nice garage and parts supply. With a few days and some elbow grease, you could basically rebuild your car or cars from the bottom up; you probably have enough parts to keep someone else's ride running or give it an upgrade, too.


-Hangar (Ace Combat) (100CP)
        Planes are fine when they're going through the air and dealing with enemies. But leaving them to the elements and the outdoors when they're not in use? Well that just seems really crass. You need somewhere to store your vehicles and planes when you're not busy destroying anything that's not on your side, and that's what these establishments are for. It's not the most fancy thing in the world, but it'll serve its purpose and make sure your means for vehicular slaughter are in prime condition for their tasks. For an additional +50CP (Included in above cost), these hangar bays also come equipped with special clamps and harnesses to make refitting and refueling any planes, go much more quickly than they would if you were using them by hand. For sea-based bases, this also means you have docks for boats and submarines.


-Manifold Destiny (Subnautica) (100CP)
        You've got one job, and you're pretty good at it. The things you build have extra hull integrity, giving you more leeway when constructing habitats. Vehicles you construct have more advanced armor, making them harder to hurt without sacrificing acceleration


-Mechanic (Fast and Furious) (100CP)
        Machines, especially ones that go fast, just speak to you. You have no problem fixing up and tuning any motor vehicle, and can rebuild them after the most devastating crashes. You can keep anything in top condition with just a few simple tools. Of course, you also need to understand the electronics, so hotwiring cars (and sometimes, alarm systems) is not a problem either.


-Titan Engineering (Titanfall) (100CP)
        Titans are incredibly complex machines, and due to the disposable nature of their use and production, and not designed for easy repair. You've got the deft touch though, and know exactly where to tweak and shore up the structure to keep it purring like it's fresh out of the drop pod for years.


-Anaheim Degree (Gundam - Universal Century) (200CP)
        You have the knowledge (and the paper to prove it to people and shove in their faces to establish superiority) of how to build MS. It's trickier than it looks, honestly. Weight balances, servo designs, energy reserves- it's all down to a science and you know how to build the basics. Who knows what you can learn from a bit of hands-on training
        MS = Mobile Suits


-Vehicular skills (Generic Zombie Apocalypse) (200CP)
        In addition to being a frankly amazing mechanic, you're also great behind the wheel you can avoid any avoidable accidents, you're quite apt at upgrading vehicle into mobile death machine


-Techy | Personal Knightmare Frame (Code Geass) (250CP)
Techy (250CP)
        From Knightmares to guns, you know how to build and improve Geass tech. 
Personal Knightmare Frame (0CP)
        Build your own Knightmare Frame, it is half the jump document, so I am not copying it all here.


-Valuable Memories (Big O) (300CP)
        You have knowledge related to any particular concept-the construction of Megadei, the nature of memories, Bigs, or the creation of chimeras. Paradigm will have a vested interest in you, and will protect you and provide you with funds if you work for them.


-Chip and Dale's Protege (Kingdom Hearts) (400CP)
        If you're going to sell your wares to the people of different worlds you'll need a way to reach them and that way is the Gummi Ship. Composed of special Gummi blocks with unusual properties, a Gummi Ship is able to navigate the corridors between worlds and now you know how to build and maintain them. You can design and balance Gummi ships for your preferred mix of offense, defence, manoeuvrability, and even appearance with ease, and the ships you make tend to work a fair bit better than they otherwise might have. You can also identify components that would work well with Gummi ships, such as weapons or engines and how to integrate them.


-Chop Shop (Ben 10 0.1) (400CP)
        Alright, you got the car. Now you need someplace to put it and fix it up when somebody inevitably wrecks it. You've got your own little garage full of everything you need to fix and maintain vehicles you own, as well as stuff like weapons and little gizmos. Even if you've got some advanced alien technology nobody else has, the tools you need to fix it up can be found here as long as it's nothing super rare or unique. Car? Easy. Laser rifle? Pick up that welder and get on it. No matter what it is, you can bring in just about anything to this chop shop and find the tools needed to fix it. Only downside is that it's not really great for things like big battleships or stuff the size of a building...it's just the size of a normal garage, after all


-Dimensional Warship (Lyrical Nanoha) (400CP)
        Ohohoho, what do we have here? It's a fully functional warship fresh from the docks of the Bureau, and its ready for its maiden voyage. It can be any model of TSAB ship that isn't a MacGuffin or an experimental prototype, and has the ability to cross dimensions on its own, along with basic FTL travel. The downsides being that you can only cross dimensions in this particular world, or what passes for a 'local multiverse' in future jumps - which it may not always be able to do if one doesn't exist. Post-Spark, this ship can visit past jumps and entirely new worlds as well. This requires a crew to fly - you'll have to gather one or find a way to fly it on your own. I recommend picking a smaller vessel class if this is a problem.


-Field Meister (Five Star Stories) (400CP)
        Ordinary Meisters have sponsors and workshops lined with tools and mortar headd scraps. After all, that's their job to build and tune the mortar he adds which form the backbone of literally every single army in the Joker Cluster. Naturally, they're highly demanded especially the ones who have made a name for themselves. You're not quite there yet, but whereas others have fame, you have talent. While no one will say it to you outright, in reality a lot of people are rather envious of your abilities as a Meister. Perhaps your lack of obfuscating memories made it earlier for you to adapt to the necessary qualities to become one but your potential as a Meister is so strong that you could tune and repair a MH even in the middle of a battlefield with nothing other than a plasma torch and some scrap metal. Frankly, you could probably rig up a temporary workshop just with stray tools lying about but it's probably best not to tempt fate by setting up permanent shop in the middle of the battlefield!


-I Like 'Em Big | Could Stand To Lose A Few Pounds (Gundam - Advanced Generation) (400CP)
        I like 'Em Big (200CP)
        Your pace continues into your preferences in MS design-along with some basic knowledge of 'Right, so I take this bolt out and everything falls to pieces without it. Don't touch it.' in your head, you can make upgrades to Mobile Suits that revolve around extra armoring and utility- making replacement parts cheaper and easier to install, reinforcing plates and glass, and generally making a unit tankier and sturdier.
        Could Stand To Lose A Few Pounds(200CP)
        When it's out in the cold expanses of space (away from that damn plotradiation), nothing counts more to you than having a well-toned machine. With some basic knowledge of 'Alright, I can't make this any thinner or it snaps like stressed knockoff plastic', you can make upgrades to Mobile Suits that shed crucial weight, making them faster, sleeker and more humanlike in motion- cutting what you can and generally making things more able to dodge, bob and weave.


-Most Holy Order of the Socket Wrench (Fast and Furious) (400CP)
        You are a master mechanic. Repair and upkeep is nice, but you can go beyond the impossible and improve any vehicle. Take a van and make it beat a supercar? Put NOS injectors on a bicycle (and make it work)? How about something challenging? And anything you can build up you can tear down, too. You're a one-man chop shop and wiring a car to explode takes but a few moments and some chicken wire.


-Resupply Ship/Fog Warships (Arpeggio of Blue Steel) (400CP)
        An autonomous resupply ship that gathers materials to re-arm Fog vessels. It has no ability to fight on its own, but is capable of filtering nanomaterials from sea water (on an industrial scale) and mining heavier elements from the sea floor or beaches. Using these materials, it can manufacture missiles, gun rounds, and other expendable weaponry, as well as provide some ability to refit Fog ships (so long as the repairs don't require a dry dock). It has a non-sentient Union Core. With some modification, it could resupply and repair other types of ships besides Fog Vessels.
        Fog warships are advanced, more like starships than seafaring vessels. Built of nanomaterials, they can change their shape and structure when needed, though they seem to prefer the shapes of WWII-era ships. For example, their turrets instead of holding normal cannons instead house photon cannons, or their hulls open to fire their super graviton cannons. Ships comprised of nanomaterials must be controlled by a Union Core, or similarly advanced computer system. If purchased by a human, or as a second ship by Mental Models, these vessels are run by a Union Core (free) which does not currently have a Mental Model.
        This one seems different from the other kinds of Fog ships, focused more on supply, repair, ability to modify ships and manufacturing of ammo and nanomaterials for use. I suggest this and the Unusual Class to be left behind


-Shipyard (Honor Harrington) (400CP)
        Well, look who struck big! This is a full-fledged Orbital shipyard, capable of making any and all ships you have the knowhow of making. It is automated to the absolutely maximum degree, and what remains is taken care of by an NPC crew of expert technicians who are not and may never become companions. It creates the resources to build both ships and space stations ex nihilo, generating enough to build one Manticoran Superdreadnought every three months.
        It updates automatically, creating new docks of whatever sizes are needed as you acquire or design new schematics and technology, along with generating any materials required. Except, that is, for any super-rare materials, which are generated at a much more reduced pace, enough to create a single ship using them in about an year.
        In future worlds, too, it automatically updates with whatever parts and materials are required to build any starships or other space constructions that you know how to build. In case building a starship absolutely requires sapient people, it generates NPCs with the requisite capabilities.


-Technical Certainties (Ace Combat) (400CP)
        Some engineers are always second guessing themselves, sticking to maintenance of machines that others use. You're so sure of your skills that you're capable of altering fighter planes to great effect, making them noticeably better than they were fresh out of the factory. Upgrades will be easy provided you have resources, and your technical prowess will ensure your plane can serve whatever role you wish of it. You could even slave the controls of ground weapons to your computers, becoming a conductor of war from the skies. You might even be knowledgeable enough to build the next superweapon...


-The Factory (9 Jumpchain) (400CP)
        Your very own version of The Machine's factory, an immense industrial complex designed to be operated by the Machine. The Factory is primarily designed to produce and supply the Steel Behemoths that The Machine was originally assigned to create, and which it used to eventually wipe out all life on Earth. This item contains all the machinery needed to create the parts needed to create the Behemoths, as well as all the fuel and ammunition. It also generates all of these, allowing for the creation of 1 Behemoth per day while generating enough parts, ammunition, and fuel to supply up to 100 constantly active Behemoths. With the right expertise, you can even reconfigure The Factory to create and support some other construct of a similar scale. If you supply it with the right materials, you can easily upscale the production capacity of The Factory. Much like The Machine's factory, this includes a harness for an AI core complete with arms that end in all manner of manipulators and tools.


-Vylon Genesis (Duel Monsters - Duel Terminal Part 2) (400CP)
        The Constellar may fight with supernatural power, but that does not mean neglecting one's studies. You've learned the ancient arts that were originally used to create the Vylons, allowing you to forge, construct, and program divine fighting robots. Creating weak ones like the Vanguards and Ohms is easy and requires relatively little resources, but the truly impressive warriors such as Alpha and Epsilon would require much work on your part. Of course, while you have all the knowledge needed to theoretically create any known Vylon, there's no reason not to innovate yourself.


-AGE System (Gundam - Advanced Generation) (600CP)
        This is a 3-part package deal, so you're getting more bang for your buck. First is the AGE Device, which is a massive data-storage unit that contains the Asuno's research data (though for you it starts only with what Flit managed to create and gather before the series start) and the blueprints for the Gundam's armor. It also acts as a key-none of the other parts of this system will operate without it. Next is the AGE Builder, which is an extremely fast 3-D printer (able to make a Mobile Suit rifle in seconds) and continuously collects data from the AGE Device and AGE System. The AGE System is a data collection program that can be installed onto a Mobile Suit and acts as a unique OS. It will collect data and evolve along with its pilot, researching 'solutions' to problems, coming in the form of the Wear Parts, arm and legs designed to improve and counter situations. The Wear Parts are flown to the AGE Gundams in battle using the AMEMBO (one of which is included with this purchase) and swapped mid-battle, though with a different design you could remove the AMEMBO from the equation entirely. This is a highly advanced system, one that can collect, analyze, improve, build and conquer many situations. A Mobile Suit equipped with the AGE System will have a bright letter on its front, defaulting to a blue 'A'-as a bonus, you may change the coloring and the letter to whatever you wish at any time.


-Always a Bigger Robot (Gurren Lagann) (600CP)
        The design and maintenance of epic machines is your specialty. You can figure out how to build starships measuring several kilometers long or devise a way to make a mountain sized mecha. You'll also have no problems getting past all the laws of physics that should make such creations impossible, perhaps Spiral Energy has something to do with it?


-Major Arcana - Chariot (Wonderland No More) (600CP)
Your body essentially functions as a “nexus point” for things that could qualify as either beast/mount or transport.  Any animal, vehicle, or other potential form of transport you own/command can be summoned directly out of your body, exiting as if you were a portal.  Size is no restriction, though large vehicles and such will cover more of your body when exiting.  The transport can exit at whatever speed you wish, so long as it is within its capabilities.  The transport(s) can also disappear back inside your body, either being stored within or teleporting to your Warehouse.  Alternatively, you can let the mount/vehicle exit “halfway”, leaving you partially merged with your ride.  However, whatever part of your body acts as the exit point ceases to exist for as long as the vehicle is crossing the portal; while the rest of your body will continue to function normally, the temporary absence of body parts can sometimes be a hindrance.


-Mechanical Genius (Star Wars - Clone Wars) (600CP)
        You're the leading expert at designing droids and starships. Given the right resources you could create fully autonomous starfighters with built in hyperdrives, battle droids with cheap, stronger and longer lasting shields, hover tanks as fast as landspeeders, androids indistinguishable from organics, and combat droids capable of killing jedi.
        This would be potentially setting breaking for the jump it came from with sufficient resources.


-Ship Girl Conversion Kit | Equipment Boxes (Azur Lane) (600CP)
        Ship Girl Conversion Kit (400CP)
        Hmm, Jumper, you already have a naval vessel? Well, why not turn it into a Ship-girl? This handy little box can be attached to any Navy ship you personally own, wherein it will grow to envelop the vessel. Over a course of time relative to the size of the ship, this device will transform the vessel into a Ship-girl of an appropriate physique compared to the rough size of the vessel being transformed. For example, the SR2 Normandy might be a Destroyer, and an Imperial-Class Star Destroyer would be analogous to a Battleship. And yes, to be perfectly clear, this Item works on any vehicle that belongs to a Navy, on water or in Space. So yes, the Death Star would count too. Your new Ship-girl will become a Companion, with a personality fitting the background of her original builders. Continuing with the analogy, the Star Destroyer would be imperious and serious, while an Apocalypse Class Battlecruiser from Warhammer 40K would be devoutly faithful and xenophobic. Your new Ship-girl will retain her full array of weaponry and power, just in a human-sized frame... This is terrifying, why am I offering you this?
        Equipment Boxes (200CP)
        Because gear, equipment, and upgrade materials for your Ship-girls is half the battle of making them stronger. Upon purchase of this Item you will receive a randomized shipment of ten boxes every week ranging in rarity from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest tier of gear. While tier 5 gear is the rarest, this purchase guarantees you at least 1 tier 5 box every month. Post-Jump this tier list will scale to your overall power level, with tier 1 becoming your baseline.


-Tech Mastermind (Lost Planet) (600CP)
        You know the insides of almost every VS and the guts of all your weaponry, and can fix them up to full standard and even beyond basic stuff like patching armor-hell, weld 2 VS together, I'm sure you'll make something great out of it. You also can make just about any sort of technology or weaponry VS-compatible, and you can-with much, much strife-do the difficult task of working on Harmonizer technology


-Consummate Knowledge | Swiss Army Engineer (Ring of Red) (700CP)
        Consummate Knowledge (100CP)
        You know everything there is to know about repairing, maintaining, and fueling AFWs. This includes a working knowledge of diesel engines, pneumatic systems, ranged and melee weapon systems, among others.
        Swiss Army Engineer (600CP)
        Most AFWs are designed by whole teams of engineers spending months, if not years, getting all the complicated systems to work together just right. But you can do it all on your own. You know how to build all AFW types from the ground up and don't have to worry about all the tedious fine-tuning most do. With further research and some time, you're confident that you can incorporate weaponry from other Jumps, albeit in a grungy, era-appropriate way.


-PROTOTYPE Γ, “JAGD PANZER” (Final Fantasy X) (700CP)
Truly the pinnacle of experimental Machina technology – it’s probably for the best if you don’t let the Yevon clergy know that you possess this. For one thing, they have a very tight grip on machina technology, and it’s not something they care to relinquish to anyone, even if you happen to be within the clergy itself. Machina use needs to be strictly controlled after all.
A tank like machina capable of sending out small flying units to act as reconnaissance drones – these drones serve two purposes, the collection of combat data as well as acting as the machina’s primary form of long ranged detection and observation. Initially, it comes with nine drones, definitely enough to be sent in all of the cardinal directions even while leaving one around for close range surveillance.
Its primary armament is a giant magic cannon, the properties of which can change, depending on the data received from the drones. Observing enough fire elemental attacks will cause the cannon to adopt fire properties, and so forth. Unfortunately, machina is still machina at the end of the day, so its replicated capabilities aren’t as amazing as you would probably hope – essentially lesser replicas of whatever it sees.
That being said, its flexibility doesn’t lie with the surveillance drones...but with the modifications available. You can add in any or all of the upgrades below:.
* Drone Factory – Attacker Models- The Jagd Panzer can create its surveillance “Watcher” drones by itself without any external modification on your part, but these Watcher drones do exactly what their name suggests and nothing else. However, you can configure the Jagd Panzer to create offensive drones instead – arming them with small magic cannons of their own that possess similar, but weaker capabilities to the main cannon of the Jagd Panzer.
* Drone Factory – Platoon Strength- If you’re going to be taking this you might as well be declaring war on the Yevon clergy folks – since that’s essentially what this modification is best for. Allowing the Panzer unit to create small machina droids that can serve different roles (long ranged attacker, short ranged harassers, patrol units and such), the only issue happens to be that the Panzer is completely immobile while churning out these units – and the speed of production isn’t the best. Still, working in coordination with the Drones, you can field an army rather effectively. The Al Bhed will be really interested in you now...
* Assembly Protocol S/A/Z- The Jagd Panzer’s upgrade capabilities are largely dependent on your mechanical proficiency, but that doesn’t mean you can’t fiddle around with some Al Bhed help – well, my help really but who’s keeping track? These Assembly Protocols will amplify the Jagd Panzer in one field, respectively its special attack properties (related to magic), its general attack properties (related to its standard ordinance), and defensive properties (both physical and magical). Each one of these protocols adds a substantial boost to the Panzer – a good kick to its performance levels that is also applied to any drones present.
* Spherimorph Capability- Never settle for barrier drones when there’s something more effective available. The Al Bhed are masters of observing and replicating natural phenomena – and the Spherimorph’s advanced elemental properties are an excellent example of how nature defends itself. Allowing the Jagd Panzer to switch between elemental properties, this significantly improves its magically oriented defences. This affects any drones that are active as well.
* Parallel Processing- Have other Machina about? As long as the machina’s size is not larger than the Jagd Panzer – you can rig it up with this so that the Jagd Panzer can remote control it. This goes for the other two prototypes as well...though you’ll find something a bit weird with the Machina Maw – it’s sufficiently small enough that if you already possess the options of construction on board the Panzer...it can recreate the Machina Maw much like how it creates drones. It’ll take longer of course, but the result will operate autonomously.




-PT Theory | Alpha Documents (Super Robot Wars OG Saga Moon Dwellers) (700CP)
        PT theory 101 (100CP)
        You've been around robots long enough to know the basics behind their engineering, at least in regards to the structure and reasoning behind the more common mechs, including the Earth Federation's standard Gespensts, and the TLI's Grungust Type 1: the example of the average Super Robot. Weapon knowledge also included in regards to both, which is basically ballistics and some small degree of beam weaponry.
        Alpha Documents (600CP)
        The whole kit-and-caboodle of the Earth Federation's current research, all in your head (or documented physically/digitally, your choice). Highlights include: the T-Link System to enhance psychic capability, the Black Hole Engine and the Gravicon system involve the manipulation of gravity for both energy and combat usage, the Tesla Drive: a device capable of enabling flight in battleships that can also be miniaturized to allow robots to fly, and the other systems and engineering for the Gespensts up to the MKIII "Alteisen" and MKIV "Weissreiter", the Huckebeins up to the Mark III, the Grungusts up to Type 3, and the Lion series models up to the Astelion. Of course some of this does require EOT resources, so you may be limited in what you can do when you don't have these resources, you might be able to substitute them with the right materials, given time and research.


-Box-Tech | A new age of warfare (Metal Gear Solid) (1000CP)
Box-tech (400CP)
 Cardboard boxes that can produce a smoke cloud? Check. Poison Cigars? Check. A mine-detector the size of a Walkman? Check. Building the sort of gadgets that MGS protagonists rely on is your thing.
A new age of warfare (600CP)
        Metal Gear, a weapon capable of bringing an entire nation to its knees (in theory) your engineering talents have extended to the point you can create these war machines, even automate them with AI, provided you have enough time and resources. With box-tech you can also invent things like man-portable railgun and stealth camo.


-"Extensive Research Notes" (White Knight Chronicles) (1200CP)
        Not a modification to your Knight itself, no. This is instead a pile of research journals filled with numerous notes and schematics detailing the processes behind the creation and modification of Knights, Knight Weapons and Knight's Arcs. The journals mention an ancient school of magic used to craft these weapons of war, but it bears a heavy resemblance to another school that seems very familiar...


-Fine Tuning | MT Engineering | AC Engineering | Core Competence (Armored Core Classic) (1800CP)
        Fine Tuning (100CP)
        A good mechanic can tune AC parts for better performance in specific areas. You're skilled at customizing them even further, at the cost of worsening some other characteristic; you can do things like modify boosters to use extra power for extra speed, or reinforce armor at the expense of added weight
        MT Engineering (400CP)
        Theoretical and practical knowledge of MT design, construction and programming. Simpler machines than ACs and much more suitable for mass production, they're the workhorse of megascale construction and the backbone of security and military forces. Your skills could earn a pretty cushy job at any of the megas. Being giant robots, these need literal tons of material and lots of labor to make. You could contract out for construction, but the simplest use for this is to design MTs for some corp instead. Also, this perk alone doesn't make you good enough to design or build really top-of-the-line MTs, the kind that might rival ACs.
        AC Engineering (400CP)
        Like MT Engineering, but for ACs and any associated equipment, from weapons to radar systems. ACs are all built for combat. They're modular in design and thus very versatile, and their specs let an AC match a small army of average MTs in the hands of the right pilot
        Core Competence (900CP)
        You are one of the world's best mech engineers; the corporations would literally kill to have you on payroll. High-performance MTs that compete evenly with ACs are now feasible- these are a bit cheaper and simpler to build than ACs, at the cost of far less customizability. Or, with even more work- probably most of your time in this jump- you might even come up with some sort of next-gen AC that chumps fellow ACs the way ACs chump their MT predecessors. Just don't expect to walk away from the job easily... that non-compete clause is murder
        Core Competence requires the other three perks, and is 900 CP on its own.




 --- Domain: Toolkits: Mundane (5) (37 Perks) --- 


-Diagnostic Tools (Outlaw Star) (50CP)
        A small data display with numerous connectors and scanners, capable of letting you know what is wrong with simple technology and what advanced technology that has been programmed into it.
        * Portable, can detect what's wrong with simple tech and do the same for advanced tech that you program into it.
        * Keep in mind 'simple' is a lot lot higher than modern tech for this scanner, it's from a space fiction.


-Holotable (Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1) (50CP)
        A device in the shape of a table used to create holographic models that allow the study, analysis and reconstruction of a vast array of items, weapons and events. Comes in any color of holograms you like and each hologram is capable of being interacted with. Naturally this performs better with additional data.


-Micromanipulators (A Certain Scientific Railgun) (50CP)
        These delicate gloves were meant for scientific purposes. They're reinforced with small motors and electrically contracting artificial muscles to allow you to perform delicate work on the scale of a micron. While they're definitely more suited to scientific experiments, they can be put to use in any situation that requires steady hands like aiming a rifle, conducting brain surgery, cooking, defusing a bomb, or even bypassing some redirection and shielding abilities.
        * Micron scale control


-Box Of Hammers (Lego Dimensions) (100CP)
        You can buy this box of hammers instead. This box comes with a dozen or so hammers, each of which grants the one holding it a copy of the Builder Power
        * Builder: You can build a mountain, if you do it brick by brick. Given all of the relevant pieces, and some sort of instructions on what to make, you can build almost any object quickly and efficiently by slotting the various pieces together. IKEA instructions are no match for your building might.


-Chemical Synthesizer (Hive Queen Quest) (100CP)
        This microwave sized machine is truly a wonder of modern science, able to synthesize any non-magical chemical known to man in up to 12 oz batches. Synthesizing a chemical takes roughly an hour and works via a small Tablet interface.
        * A bit underpriced for any matter creator, even with the small volume and time needed, born from lacking knowledge that ever matter falls under chemical.


-Cranial implants (Warhammer 40k: Adeptus Mechanicus) (100CP)
        The brain of every magos undergoes extensive modification over time, but you have put great care into preparing your mind for the Machine God's mysteries. Beyond the gene-alterations and bionic sub-systems that have boosted your intelligence, regulated neuro-chemistry reduces the influence that hunger, pain, fear and other flesh-distractions can have upon your thoughts. Your ability to enjoy these things are not impeded. Further neurological modifications will be faster and easier to adapt to with less worry of rejection.


-Data Access (Endless Pantheon) (100CP)
        Having knowledge isn't always good enough, seeing as it can be quite the hassle to actually access it if you don't have the proper setup. You do, thankfully. This is one device of your choosing, which allows you to perfectly access any and all books, scrolls or databanks you have, putting all of the knowledge you have gathered at your fingertips at all times. It can also change forms, but is always something digital. Try not to stand too close to the wizard.


-Deep pockets (Endless Pantheon) (100CP)
        A small bag filled with some absolute essential things, this is the sort of thing that can save your life. It's tiny, and enchanted so it can't be detected with any supernatural means. What it does is provide you with a tiny portal to your warehouse, big enough to draw out anything an ordinary man can lift with one hand.


-Exo-Womb (Freefall) (100CP)
        The first generation of Bowman's Wolves were gestated in dogs with genetically modified red wolf DNA. Now you can have your future generations be developed in a more controlled environment. Simply insert one or more viable biological samples that are no smaller than a single drop of blood into the receptacle and this will provide a perfect and indestructible environment for the child. If you are one of the donors, any perks relating to children and inheritance may apply. It takes the typical amount of time and only works with organisms of the same species unless you have perks to alter that.


-Magic Hammer (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - SB) (100CP)
        A large unadorned metal hammer, any item struck by this hammer will experience an increase in durability and item condition. This effect can't push them past the condition they were in when new, but it does scale with the force behind the hammer blow, with small taps removing minor dents, while powerful blows can fix major cracks in a single go.


-Matter Manipulator (Starbound) (100CP)
        Manipulates anything that matters. Well,solids, at least. It basically allows for the collection of any and all materials. For an extra 100 CP, it can collect liquid, and also mines 4 times faster, 4 times as much at once and twice as far away. It can also paint stuff as wire things. If you don't purchase this, you'll have to get the upgrades yourself with manipulator modules.
        * This is the 4chan version, the SB version is a whole chapter.


-Satisfactorio Builder | Craft Bench Card | Pattern Extension Chip (Satisfactory-factorio Gauntlet) (100CP)
        Satisfactorio Builder (0CP)
        The buildy gun from Satisfactory. It can place down buildings and other artificial structures, either from parts or premade. It can deconstruct buildings and other artificial objects, either breaking them down or storing them whole. It can give orders to logistic or construction systems that you are authorized on (including the ones from this Gauntlet.) It can configure the settings of machines. It has an internal inventory that can be upgraded (to a limited extent until you leave the Gauntlet.)
        Always fully charged, can be upgraded in other ways, automatically imports into similar handheld stuff, and syncs up with other inventory/storage Perks, Items, and items. If lost, stolen, or broken, it will respawn in an appropriate and safe place immediately, even during the Gauntlet.
        Craft Bench Card (50CP)
        This card, when installed in the Satisfactorio Builder, lets it craft any recipe that you can craft at any crafting station internally, though slower than you could at a dedicated station.
        Pattern Extension Chip (50CP)
        This card, when installed in the Builder, grants it the ability to create ad-hoc blueprints based on existing machines, and then fill those blueprints in. You can use it to quickly and easily extend groups of belts, or lines of machines. It will faithfully execute patterns that change as they iterate. It also allows doing multiple patterns, such as two production lines for different products and the foundations at once, even if those patterns don't line up or have different lengths.


-The Right Tools For The Job (Freefall) (100CP)
        Every job requires tools, be they a socket wrench, measuring tape, a hand saw, or mop. So long as it is either mundanely accessible without background checks or you already have it, you can summon a copy of any tool you need. This only applies to when you're cleaning, fixing, building, or other material-based preparation. You can't directly use it in combat and you can't use the material of the tool itself.
        * In case it is not clear, free summon of any tool you own to your hand at will.


-The Toolkit (Sabaton) (100CP)
        When wielding this toolkit, you can repair devices most would think broken beyond salvation. You could find two twisted armor plates and a couple of treads and before you know it, you have a tank that's as good as new.
        * Extremely op portable repair kit
        * Arguably reality warping or influences the wielder as text gives no mention of the users own skills


-Tool box (Generic Factory) (100CP)
        This Tool Box can store any number of hand held tools, and will never get too heavy to carry. Always contains a set of basic tools that can be called on without notice and in any number like hammers, saws and blowtorches. Specialized tools you will have to place inside this box ahead of time.


-PDA | Scanner | Upgraded scanner | Habitat Constructor (Subnautica) (150CP)
PDA (0CP)
        Loaded with an emergency intelligence and more data capacity than you could ever use, this is a survivor's second most powerful tool (after his or her brain.) The AI may get a bit . . . quirky . . . over long deployments. Your version is basically indestructible. Contains basic construction blueprints.
Habitat Constructor (50CP)
        As long as the materials are present in your subspace inventory, the Habitat Constructor is capable of creating robust outposts and domiciles. Due to complex structural requirements, the constructor is unable to build anything that isn't anchored to the ground.
        * "Complex structural requirements" implies that with sufficient technical abilities this limitation can be overcome.
Scanner (50CP)
        The scanner uses the PDA artificial intelligence to analyze an object, often finding weaknesses or uses not immediately apparent to the user. If one of your fabricators is capable of constructing the scanned object, a blueprint is created. Scanning time varies with size and complexity.
        Upgraded scanner (50CP)
        For those who don't want to get too close to the Reaper Leviathan, but just really want that scan, this upgrade quadruples the scanning distance and speed.


-AR Masking Software | 'The Eye' AR Windows (Eclipse Phase) (200CP)
        AR Masking Software (100CP)
        Augmented Reality software overlays your vision with realistic (or not-so-realistic) graphics, effectively changing or adding to what you see. This is normally used as a navigational aid (eg: painting a path in your vision to show the route to something) or for gaming, but you could also use it for many other purposes - for example you could give your muse a "body" that seems to move around the environment or fill an empty room with a simulated crowd, but of course it wouldn't be able to interact with anything. It can also edit out things you don't want to see (leaves a red outline in place for safety reasons), or place censoring over things. This version has zero lag and no advertisements, and is shared to any companions who have mesh inserts.
        'The Eye' AR Windows (100CP)
        These AR display windows match things in your field of vision to data from Firewall's databases, wikis, chat channels and forum posts - so if you happen to walk past a known trafficker of TITAN artifacts on the streets of Noctis, an AR window will flag them and display what The Eye knows about them. Unfortunately, The Eye is only good for things that Firewall knows about - new threats won't raise flags or have any data. In future worlds, The Eye AR windows tend to flag things in the databases or general awareness of groups with similar objectives to Firewall, but are fairly light on hard data - mostly something like "This individual is wanted for questioning by SHIELD and is considered armed and dangerous" or "This carving is a sign used by Thayan spies to mark meeting spots". You can dismiss the AR windows or keep them from appearing at any time.
        * Masking software can serve as a memetic filter with decent programming.
        * Windows can provide access to the information of any secretive organisation.


-Architect Gizmo Pack (Terraria - Journey's End) (200CP)
        A backpack full of tools that can greatly increase construction speed, and also allows the user to place and interact with objects from a fairly significant distance.


-Faber Set (Draka Series) (200CP)
        This is a small device, about the size of your usual attache case, with flanged pans down the sides. Part of the standard gear of the Samothracian cyber-commandos of the interstellar era, this is a full set of Nano-Fabricators, ready for you to use. Put stuff in the left pan, and the faber breaks it down on the molecular level and reassembles it in the right pan. You can build anything that you have schematics for or have reverse-engineered a sample of, provided that you have sufficient raw elements to form the necessary compounds and it's something that actually can be reproduced by a non-magical molecular assembly device. This is a smaller model, so if you want to use it to build a large machine with this you'll need to build parts and assemble them manually. You do, however, also get a full-size Industrial Fabricator installed in your warehouse, ready for whatever purposes you might care to use it for.


-Hands Of A Fran (Franken Fran) (200CP)
        6 attachable arms that link up to your nervous system, they greatly enhance speed and multitasking, with no drop in precision or control. Become a one-man surgery team. Free bulky labcoat to conceal the arms.
        * Assuming each pair symbolizes an extra mental thread, when utilized with powers from under Time, it gets rather crazy, effectively multiplying your building speed by 4.


-Omnitool | Scanner (Mass Effect Andromeda) (200CP)
        Omnitool (100CP)
        You get an omni-tool loaded up with programs and information that'd be best suited for unsupported colonization in a new galaxy. Because the Andromeda Initiative knew that they'd be going with a finite supply of ammo, medi-gel and power cells, each omni-tool can recover and repurpose appropriate resources to serve appropriate functions. For example, liquid coolant allows weapon heatsinks to be reused, and organic compounds can be refined into medi-gel. They can also convert consumable items into immediately usable forms. Finally, they do everything else regular omni-tools can: Communication, manufacturing fabricator, sensor analysis, and computer mainframe.
        Scanner (100CP)
        This omni-tool mounted system is how the Andromeda Initiative plans to rapidly survey planets. This system is a fast and accurate sampling system that is formally known as Panoptes. When linked to an AI, it can produce multiple analyses and predictive models in seconds, turning what would be the surveying work of weeks into mere moments. For most purposes it uses a transmitted accelerator mass spectrometer to create a snapshot of an objects components, atomic weight, and radioactivity, allowing for in-depth analysis. For biological materials, the system switches to an electrospray ionization system, so that plants or animals can be scanned without causing radiation damage. For a Jumper, you no longer need to have an AI linked to the system for it to work, though that would help. You can also take DNA scans of organisms for further study, and scan devices to help you figure out what they do, and maybe later reproduce them. Lastly, if you have a longer ranged sensor system, you could link the Scanner to that to scan further away, even if being in the Scanner's original range would get you clearer results.


-One-Stop Crafting Station (Starbound) (200CP)
        A single large workbench that can reconfigure its surface and toolset to handle all of your crafting needs. As long as you provide the ingredients and recipes / blueprints, you can use this crafting station to construct anything you want. Note that while you could use this to help you build all the pieces of a starship or skyscraper, you'd still have to put all those pieces together yourself.


-PSYCHOSCOPE (PREY) (200CP)
        The Psychoscope is an advanced scanning tool developed by Morgan Yu to gather information about the Typhon. It is able to provide an experienced user specialised information about the aliens which can be used to develop new Neuromods. The device was built around the Typhon, though can be used on humans and robots. It will require an update if you want to use it to scan a new biologist, which can be built with the right skills. A Psychoscope can support 8 chipsets at a time, not including its core scanning hardware and has a stock range of about 10 meters.


-Scanner (Iji) (200CP)
        Serves a number of purposes. Primarily, allows you to determine the location of all living creatures within a large radius around the user, although this might be blocked by certain defenses or stealth abilities. Also capable of determining molecular structure and provides blueprints when scanning objects.
        * Can detect living things at large range and get molecular structure and blueprints for objects. Is portable.


-Utility Mods (Dead Space) (200CP)
        Ah, technology, the best part of the future. The Kinesis Module projects an artificial gravity field from an emitter pad on the palm of the hand it's mounted on. Much like the name might imply, this field allows you to lift objects; smaller objects hover about a foot in front of your palm, whereas larger objects, most of which must be specifically modified to work with it and are typically on tracks or rails, move as close to you as they are able. You can manipulate these objects with your hand, and even throw them with a surprising amount of force, enough to penetrate a body with a bone spike and nail it to a steel wall. Stasis, on the other hand, as its name might imply, creates a temporal stasis field of a certain volume around the targeted object. It affects both organic and inorganic material, including living creatures, and has no problem with irregularly-shaped objects, flowing out around the targeted object.
        * Allows for the movement of objects remotely as well as freeze them in place while working on them.


-Warehouse Roboport (Factorio) (200CP)
        A tablet that always returns to you after being lost or destroyed controls a small fleet of robots that fly out of a hatch in the cosmic warehouse's ceiling. These drones can move small items and will work together to carry up to a ton at a time, and have tools that allow for simple constructions to be performed, if you provide the system with digital blueprints. The drones can range a kilometer from the door to the cosmic warehouse, but can link up with constructed roboports to extend their range. The robots vanish if the warehouse door closes. The robots can draw from both normal and warehouse versions of the provider chests. You start with a single normal version of the provider chest, with plans to make more. You will have to source the tools and materials to do such from elsewhere.


-Digital Storage System (Infinite Stratos) (300CP)
        A small remote control that links to a storage of digitised matter, this allows one to store and instantly summon with a click of a button a great array of materials or objects. The remote is able to store up to several IS frames at a time at maximum, though there is no particular limit on it only storing IS frames. If you want to pack it full of missiles or bombs, it could make a deadly surprise weapon.


-Modular Armor (Factorio) (300CP)
        An armored and environmentally sealed suit, designed to keep the wearer alive in a wide variety of alien environments. On-board recycling systems handle waste, keep the internals clean, and produce clean water along with a nutritious if tasteless paste to feed the wearer. Occasional top-offs with fresh water and biomass will be required. But the main draw of this armor is the extremely robust power system and programming suite that can quickly install and adapt to new attachments, integrating them into existing systems and adjusting them to best suit the wearer. Comes with a portable fusion reactor, battery array, strength- and speed-boosting exoskeleton, and night vision attachments pre-installed. You may import another suit of armor you own to gain these qualities.


-Neural Plugs | VR Construct Hub (The Matrix) (300CP)
        Neural Plugs (100CP)
        Humans are no longer born outside of Zion. They are grown, and the plugs upon your body are a mark of shame... as well as a mark of pride, for turning the tools of the Machines against them. A plug on the base of your skull, along with plugs in various places on your body, will allow you to inject things into yourself and connect plugs much more efficiently than stabbing yourself, as well as giving you an 'in' to the Matrix. For an additional 50CP, you can also be given a 'neural rig' chair set-up, allowing one to connect to the Matrix and its related functions without a plug. Interesting how wireless can offer so many options.
        VR Construct Hub (200CP)
        Sometimes all you need is just a way to get things in order... or visualize it, if need be. This machine system is a virtual workspace or "loading program" created to run simulations or upload virtual objects inside a computer-generated reality, allowing you to essentially world-build or train someone. Of course there's a limit to what you can do, with processing power and the energy required to maintain it... but I'm sure if you hooked it up to the right machines, you could say, have people controlling a city's defense grid inside a white room. Or generate places to hone one's skills. ...just don't do anything too bad with this? Please?


-STC Converter (Warhammer 40k: Adeptus Mechanicus) (300CP)
        This tome-sized cogitator is designed to be fed blueprints for alien or out-of-jump technology and convert them to use STC-standard parts and design principles, well-known for being extremely robust. Perfect translation and equal functionality is not guaranteed, while technology that relies on unique materials or scientific principles not native to the 40k setting will most likely be impossible to recreate. The blueprints that result from successful conversions can be followed by any competent tech-priest. Running blueprints for Magitech or psionic technology through this device without a supreme understanding of 40k metaphysics is an exceedingly bad idea.


-C Cube (Artemis Fowl) (400CP)
        Ah. Yes, this. This is a curious little thing, especially since it's not supposed to exist yet when you enter the jump. But you have it anyway. This is a small cube, of a colour of your choice, with a pop-out keyboard and screen that open on command. This is, well, the be all and end all of computer technology, in one little package.
        It can interface with any electronic or digital data storage or communication medium, any phone or computer, simply by being in their proximity, or in the proximity of any device connected to them via a network. It can even interface with radio waves and similar transmissions, or 'surveillance beams'.
        It has unlimited storage and obscene processing power, being able to access, hack and control any and all computer systems, no matter how advanced, in seconds at the very most. It can break any code, and download any amount of data, all in moments. Any data acquired can be 'compensated', bringing spotty videos to 4k quality and shitty audio to the finest surround sound you can imagine, the same applicable for other forms of data.
        It can function as a phone, computer and TV, including presenting itself as different devices if it's had a chance to 'download' them. It could tell if you were being observed by a satellite, and the registration number and owners of the sat too.
        It's indestructible, and comes with an inviolable connection to the internet. All of them, in fact. The internet for every world you've been to and go to hereafter, listed side by side. Though every connection other than the one to your current world is one-way only, meaning you can read and watch and download all you want, but can't send anything back.


-Cracked Desktop CM (Eclipse Phase) (400CP)
        A desktop cornucopia machine, about the size of a large photocopier, with all safety and copyright limiters removed. It can make almost anything you have the blueprints and correct feedstock for. It can't make antimatter or anything that requires nanotech more advanced than this setting has. If you are trying to make something bigger than the CM itself, you may need it to print smaller parts you then assemble.
        * The best nanotech of the setting can go up to femtotech and picotech


-Promethean Hacking Apps (Eclipse Phase) (400CP)
        A collection of dizzyingly advanced software tools that can turn an average Joe or an AI into a reasonable hacker, and give an excellent hacker the chance to beat a TITAN at their own game assuming a level playing field, of course. Not even this software will out-hack a TITAN if your hardware, connection and mental speed are lacking.
        * TITANS are unchained exponentially upgrading AIs
        * A 'reasonable hacker' is in terms of the far flung future when network security AIs are a thing and people are extremely paranoid about network security because quite a lot of people live digitally.


-Silver Wonder (Digimon World Re: Digitize) (400CP)
        A unique tablet capable of functioning just fine wherever you take it; be it in a digital world or a realm between dimensions. Aside from effectively being an entire computer engineering workshop in the palm of your hand, and possessing an unlimited internet connection; this technological marvel is capable of actively manipulating the data in digital worlds in the hands of a sufficiently skilled and knowledgeable user, allowing them to bring their digital dreams to life. Moreover, it has exceptional sensor arrays for its size; allowing it to scan an island sized region for all sorts of energy signatures and disturbances once properly programmed, or even analyze ongoing phenomenon.
        * Given that the digital world is essentially another dimension this item essentially allows for indirect reality warping.


-The Seed (Sword Art Online SB) (400CP)
        You've come across something quite impressive here Jumper, the culmination of Akihiko Kayaba's work and something that can revolutionise the world if properly applied. The most basic and obvious use of this is as a development kit a preset series of program packages and media resources that can be used for creating Virtual Reality worlds, as well as control the input and output of the five senses of players, provided they're wearing the NerveGear or a device based off it.The second element contained within is the famed Cardinal System, an AI developed to manage the entire system of Sword Art Online, providing balancing to enemy encounters and patching bugs based off what the players encounter and do during play. Why, it can even provide mental care through the Mental Health Counseling Programs it has as part of its sub-system, helping to ensure players are happy and mentally healthy as they play through the game. Cardinal was also famed for creating content whole-cloth without any human input, scouring the internet to craft quests or enemies based off mythology; if you wanted to you could be a one-man game developer for something rivaling a AAA title in content and quality. With study and effort it's possible to replicate Cardinal and the mental health programs, crafting new AI on the same level as the Mental Health Counseling Program within the Companions section.


-Analytic Tool | Objective Scanner (Generic Space Opera) (600CP)
        Analytic Tool (400CP)
        With a short scan, this device can reveal nearly anything about an object in question, from general structure and chemical composition, to life signs or medical problems, to general energy readings. You may import any smartphone or tablet device you already own for this option - yes, even the tablet you could gain from the Stellar Charts-item.
        Objective Scanner (200CP)
        The Analytic Tool greatly improves its resolution allowing for near perfect scans of sub-molecular composition, energy constructs and even more ethereal occurrences.
        * Author stated in a comment on the doc that the text as written misrepresents what it was intended to be in response to a comment criticising how it was underpowered in comparison to comparably priced perks in the same doc so it is likely more powerful than the text implies.


-Proto-Tool (Ben 10 0.1) (600CP)
        Proto-Tool Why carry around individual weapons and gadgets all the time? Why not just put all of them into one package? Looks like someone thought about this question long enough to invent this nifty little catch-all tool. The Proto-Tool is a highly advanced device that can change into just about any sort of weapon or bit of gear. Need a scanner? It's a scanner now. Need an energy bow? It's an energy bow. Fishing rod? Flashlight? Vacuum? Energy blaster? You name it, the Proto-Tool can change into it. Just about any person-sized device you can imagine, it can change into. The downside is that it has a finite battery life and will need to recharge after extensive amounts of use, and generally won't make things like a person-sized doomsday weapon without some serious upgrades. You may also add individual weapons or tools to this if you wish, adding more arsenal to your...well, arsenal.
        * Power requirements are trivialized by any of the numerous infinite energy items in many jumps.
        * Acts as any tool up to a certain size and thus short of fiat essentially invalidates most other tools.
        * Unclear if it can be multiple tools at once.

-Art Set (A 'Happy' Harry Potter Fanfiction) (50CP)
        A full art kit stored in a small expanded carry case for all your drawing or painting needs. Comes with a small paint can that can change to different colored infinite paint, both indoor and outdoor options, never dries out if left open, and doesn't get contaminated by dirt or other colors left on the brush. Chalk, pencils, and crayons won't break, require sharpening, or be used up. Drawing pages or canvas can be changed to other types and will never run out with the finished picture being saved to your folder, and brushes will never degrade or get bent, broken bristles nor run out if they're lost or pulled.
        The brushes come in a range of sizes from the wide indoor wall painter to the tiniest canvas detailer. Pencils, crayons, and chalk are much the same as are the colored varieties. A pack of special white erasers are included, ranging from small to large, that don't wear down or spread the erased material but can nevertheless undo any of your drawn or painted projects if necessary. The case and all its inventory can be found in your warehouse if lost, stolen, or destroyed.


-Transposing Kiln (Dark Souls 3) (50CP)
        An old transposing kiln from Courland, crafted with stitched crystal lizard hide. This kiln can transpose twisted souls to craft special items with their concentrated essence. Deemed forbidden by those unable to make proper use of it.


-Armor-Shift Manufacture (Bloody Roar) (100CP)

-Carving kit (Diablo 1&2) (100CP)
        The tools within this leather satchel are of exceptional quality and have been ritually prepared for work with delicate magical reagents. Having these will make Gemcutting and runecarving much easier. A sheaf of paper in a waterproof scroll case notes useful details on several basic runes and the most common semi-precious gems, but it lacks details on multi-rune sequences and the rarest stones. Still, the papers make a good reference, and they will automatically update themselves when you discover new information through experimentation or research. If lost or destroyed, the kit will reappear in your possession the next day


-Crafting Table (Minecraft) (100CP)
        You can easily assemble a few planks into a crafting table, upon which you can, nigh instantly, produce almost anything, so long as you have all the parts and know the recipe. Items larger than a 1m3 cube, or which are not designed to be worn on your person or carried in your hand, may require more advanced crafting techniques, but you'll still find it easier to make the parts for it. Complex items usually require a bunch of subparts, and figuring out all the recipes for them can be difficult.


-Etching Pen (A 'Happy' Harry Potter Fanfiction) (100CP)
        A specialized etching tool that can carve stone, wood, metal, or other hardened surfaces like a hot knife through butter or switch to a regular pen that can write on any softer surfaces such as rice paper. The tool is capable of erasing any damages it causes, reversing inked mistakes, and even absorbing certain fluids like blood, acid, ink, or venom to write with. The tool will always be sharp and never run out of whatever fluid it has currently Absorbed.


-Griffon Quill Pen (Monster Girl Encyclopedia) (100CP)
A special pen made from the feather of the valiant Griffon, it embodies the beast’s prideful guardianship of treasures.  You can use it to write runes on things and people you closely cherish, and enforce your assertion of ownership to protect your precious treasures from harm.

-Magic Cooking Pot (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - SB) (100CP)
        A simple iron pan, that can magically light a fire underneath itself when set up. Even when off of a fire, it will heat items placed in it to the desired temperature. All meals and elixirs cooked on it will receive a boost in quality, and can provide a variety of beneficial effects, depending on the ingredients used. Magically provides a comfortable temperature nearby when in use.


-Enchanting Board (Scooby Gamers) (200CP)
        You have a certified enchanting board. Not only does it allow multiple people to pool their mana in order to fuel the enchanting process, every person that donates mana to the project also gains the same amount of 'experience' as the person doing the enchanting. Enchantments made to things using this board are guaranteed to be more effective than they would be with a normal enchanting board.


-Golden Sickle (Asterix the Gaul) (200CP)
        This is a sickle made of solid gold, perfect for harvesting materials with magical properties. So perfect, that it has properties of its own. Firstly, any materials harvested using this sickle will never go bad. Food doesn't rot, meat, if you somehow used it on that, doesn't go rancid, magical herbs don't lose their powers. Secondly, it tends to have the exact magical properties you need to harvest any and all magical substances, without too much of a fuss. In essence, you can replace any and all growing and harvesting requirements for an ingredient, like 'needs to see the moon twenty times', or 'dance naked under at twilight carrying a pitcher of water that you then sprinkle' with 'cut using this sickle'. Doesn't apply on the super rare, absolutely one-of-a-kind stuff, mind you. It must be at least somewhat common.


-Precision Tools (God Catching Alchemy Meister) (200CP)
        Exactly what it says on the tin. A collection of the best tools used to perform the local Alchemy. From chisels to mixing sets and other useful trinkets. While you probably already have or can get the minimum required tools to perform Alchemy in shops, this comes with upgrades adding more tools every jump you visit, provided that version of "Alchemy" involves adding magical properties to regular processes.


-Silver Needles of Intricate Design (Exalted - The Lunars) (200CP)
        This set of moonsilver needles is special in a very particular way, as it literally cannot do otherwise than perform good tattoo procedures. If you attempted to stab someone's chest with one of these needles, it would twist and shape itself such that you've just marked a simple design on their skin. Each a perfect instrument to tattoo the body, these needles provide a potent tool for the use of body decorations. Making even the most elegant and complex patterns and designs easy to apply for the one who uses these, as they innately correct even the slightest mistake their user makes. Moreover, their use will never cause infection or injury, and the surface of the tattoo will seal over nearly instantly after it is applied.
        Along with the needles themselves, you will also receive a supply of many different mundane inks of exceptional quality. Though of course the needles can also be used with various other inks you might be able to acquire. They can handle anything, from the mundane ones to sorcerous inks to tattoo occult sigils, to chalcanth used to create living demon-ink tattoos, to stranger substances still, and even the moonsilver ink used to create the Moonsilver Tattoos and various tattoo artifacts. That last one in particular resonates with the Silver Needles, for when they are used with moonsilver ink, they may cause the Moonsilver Tattoos to become temporarily fluid and accept new tattoo artifacts to be inscribed upon the skin of their wearer.
        * For mundane and magic tattoo crafting at any level


-Tool Kit (Haroun and the Sea of Stories) (200CP)
        A special toolkit essential for any Water Genie. While the items may look like standard tools at a distance in the dark, a close look reveals that each is more fluid than solid, being made up of thousands of little liquid veins somehow held together by an invisible force. The various tools can scan, link, and disconnect story water streams and other dream facets, not only within the dream world but also at the border of the real world. And since the tools are actually liquids, they could be potentially be used to fiddle with other sorts of liquids. The tools often have multiple functions, such as an emergency transponder.


-Wiring Gear (Terraria - Journey's End) (200CP)
        A set of wrenches and a few hundred feet of wire that can be used to connect various switches, pressure plates, and buttons to objects to control them or direct power to them. Comes with a few basic switches and plates, and instructions on how to make more, as well as a Mechanical Lens that can help you to see connecting wires. The wire restocks within a day. For an undiscounted extra 100 CP (Included in above cost), this also comes with instructions on how to make teleporters, which can be wired together to transport whatever is on them between each other when activated.


-Revitalizing Kitchen Knives (Toriko) (250CP)
A special type of knives required to perform the Dark Technique, forged using organisms with regenerative function and minerals that stimulate that function; cutting an ingredient with this knife will make the cells of the ingredient become active and thus revitalizing the wound. To use this knife a near superhuman ability is needed in order to pass the knife in the gaps between cells without damaging them; if someone can use it freely an ingredient can be eaten almost infinitely by restoring it little by little; in order to complete the regeneration eating high nutritional value ingredients is needed. The use of the revitalizing kitchen knife is limited by the IGO in fear of them upsetting the circulation of food. The knife can only help the regeneration of an ingredient or person but can't revitalize dead people or beasts.


-Glove of the East (Binbougami Ga!) (300CP)
        This hand of mine glows with an awesome power! It's burning gri-... oh! Sorry, wrong show. This single glove comes in any color and style, and is actually quite useful! You can channel your spiritual energies through it to help you with mundane tasks; your cooking might turn out excellent, cleaning takes less work for better results, and massages work WONDERS when you hit those points. If you channel a LOT of spiritual energy, you might even imbue items and equipment to improve them and be more receptive to your spiritual/chi powers! Heart symbol optional.


-Herbalists Kit (My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic) (300CP)
        Magically collects nearby herbs and spices and stores them in a magical freshness ensuring stasis inside itself while sorting and naming them. It also includes a small instruction booklet that teaches basic herbalism. The names of the herbs and spices it collects are stored in the book.


-Plentiful Mouths (Haroun and the Sea of Stories) (300CP)
        A Plentimaw Fish is called such due to it having dozens of maws [i.e., mouths] all over its body. You now have the same trait, with several dozen mouths scattered across your body. They can be retracted and concealed from the view of others if you like. When exposed, you can control the many mouths individually or in unison, such that they can speak in many different voices or all as one. As a result, you could say multiple statements, songs, or spells (voice-activated ones) simultaneously. But the greatest strength of having so many mouths is the ability to mix different things together. By absorbing different things in each mouth, whether it is normal food or various stories, they will all meet in your singular stomach and blend together into something new, which combines the best qualities of each ingredient into something special. For instance, two different power-ups would merge as one, and three stories would link into a single narrative. You can also regurgitate the combined mixture.


-Armsfusion Crafter (Aion) (400CP)
        This magical machine will merge any two weapons or pieces of armor placed into it into a single weapon or piece of armor. The two items need not be weapons or armor, but they must be similar. The machine is roughly the size of a coffin. When used the items merge so that it keeps the superior properties of each without stacking old properties. For example sword A has +5 str. Sword B has +3 str as well as deals lightning damage. The resulting sword would have +5 str and lightning dmg.


-Horadric Cube | Horadric Malus (Diablo 1&2) (400CP)
Horadric Cube (200CP)
        A copy of an ancient artifact created by the mage clans, which was itself a copy of an even older device, this engraved cube is a potent tool of alchemy and transformation. The cube's four most common uses are to repair, refine, transmute, or dismantle items. The cube can repair broken magical items to full functionality, though you may need to add in reagents to make up for lost mass and energy. Multiple items of the same type placed inside will be consumed to create a single slightly more potent version. Items can be transmuted into other items of a different shape yet similar nature, such as arrows into bolts. Finally, magical items can be fragmented, enchantments and power cleanly divided between each piece, a function commonly used to store dangerous items in a more manageable form.
Horadric Malus (200CP)
        An ancient and heavily-enchanted hammer, this tool was built to aid in forging magical items. In layman's terms it regulates and stabilizes magical energies, preventing small mishaps, foreign mana flows, short pauses in the enchanting process and other such problems from ruining an enchanter's work. While items produced with the aid of the Malus are only slightly more powerful, they are much more resistant to mystical tampering and corruption.


-Philosopher's Stone (DC Occult) (400CP)
        A perfect replica of the Philosopher's Stone, one of the Four Wonders of Alchemy. Legendary even outside of occult circles and widely sought after, the Philosopher's Stone is the ultimate goal of every alchemist to ever live. The small stone possesses the ability to alter the molecular structure of inorganic matter into other elements.


-SCP 914's Manual (SCP Foundation) (400CP)
        This book is kind of... stupidly thin for what it claims to be. Really, it's hard-covered and barely a quarter-inch thick, and it has, "SCP-914," embossed on the front of it in gold-leaf. Opening it and flipping through it shows why it's this thin: It's probably been passed through 914 on, "Very Fine," itself; you can easily turn past the seeming end of the book without any trouble. Contained in its pages are instructions for making your own instance of SCP-914 and even hooking it into your Warehouse's utilities if you have any, an explanation of what each of the settings does, in excruciating detail, how to effectively combine items, and even how to care for it and repair one if damaged. It is recommended not to put sapient creatures through it, on any of the settings, in dozens of places inside the manual, but those are obviously just recommendations.


-Stravhs' Whetstone (Banner Saga) (400CP)
        In the stories, The God Stravhs sold silver weapons to the other Gods so they might kill each other. This whetstone hones any weapon to perfect sharpness or functionality and makes it incredibly potent in slaying enemies supernatural or divine.


-Unique Uniques (Modded Skyrim) (400CP)
        You know, is there really a point to making haxcalibur if it looks the same as any other broadsword? That's just a waste. Thats where this thing comes in! It's a small ring with a black stone embedded. Wearing it will allow you to visually reskin any customized, special, unique, or otherwise non ordinary weapon, armor, or item you can get your hands on. Your choice if said change is retroactive.


-Eternal Flame (Everyone Else is a Returnee) (600CP)
        An inextinguishable and living flame that can continuously grow. This flame is precious even within Heaven. The more flames and magic stones it is fed, the stronger and hotter it becomes. This flame has a high level of intelligence, akin to that of a human. This flame is extremely useful for the processing of general materials and ores as even if it cannot process them immediately, it can eventually grow to the point where it can. Additionally, as this flame grows, it may become useful in other ways. Yu Ilhan incorporated the Eternal Flame into several of his items to boost the strength of their attack.


-The Black Cauldron (A 'Happy' Harry Potter Fanfiction) (600CP)
        Yes, that one but a much more user friendly version. A magical indestructible cauldron in which any potion can be brewed to perfection even if the actual results produce a failed solution. With this you'll have no need for silver, gold, brass, or any other type of metal made pot to create your elixirs in and it can be set to produce an infinite amount of whatever potion is made in it until you require another. The cauldron will also eat any sludge left over so that the inside is clean when you next need to use it. The cauldron will produce an undead army on command with the proper chant or revive one person per year to full life and health. Is enchanted to be featherlight so you can lift it without strain.Comes with a complete index of ingredients, their properties, and reactions when mixed, which updates with each world in their own section, as well as a high quality alchemical master's potions kit with all magical and common alchemical ingredients, all the tools and stirring implements to prepare them, plus twenty unbreakable vials, as well as protective gear. The tools are self maintaining and the ingredients self replenishing. A set of fifteen unbreakable empty vials are included which when filled with a potion of your choice will continue to produce that potion ex nihilo, so pick your choices with care. Finally, the whole ensemble can be found in the warehouse if lost or stolen. Includes A small case with a compartment that has a replenishing store of a range of potion regents. Such regents replenish once every two weeks and come in reasonable quantities. Does not contain any extremely rare ingredients.


-The Mixing Cauldron | Melting Pot | Spirit Pyroxene | Goldberg Formula | Daisy Chain | The Vortex (Atelier: Arland Trilogy) (600CP)
        The Mixing Cauldron (100CP)
        Every Alchemists' trusty tool, the mixing cauldron, is basically the alchemist's work desk and research station combined into one. With this, no potion is out of reach though it isn't uncommon to find that some alchemists' will create...other things from their cauldrons, and one would be foolish to presume that a cauldron can't be improved...
        Melting pot (100CP)
        It's not uncommon to find that certain ingredients will not mix well just as attempting to stack too many enchantments into a potion can prove disastrous. In an attempt to mitigate this, the melting pot was constructed with a higher rate of mixing. This directly translates to a higher degree of homogenization, but you'll have to understand that to maintain this level of mixing you need to have a higher energy source than just a fire under the cauldron. It does allow you to blend some ingredients that normally would not mix however, though the results may still not be as optimal as you would hope.
        Spirit Pyroxene (100CP)
        No one quite knows where this pyroxene came from, but it has a very definitive effect on the items that it forms a component of. The mystical power inside the pyroxene seems to carry over into the items that it forms at least a portion of the power does, and the crafted items became more conductive towards spiritual magic of a large variety.
        Goldberg Formula (100CP)
        There are times when making things overly complex can be problematic. Then there are times when making things overly complex can be outright awesome. Your cauldron really shouldn't be called a cauldron anymore. Synthesis isn't a matter of tossing in ingredients and brewing. Your cauldron is a part of a system, a large chain of components and contraptions which ultimately will create a potion likely of higher quality. But you'll likely have no clue how it works. Due to the nature of this set up, you'll find that the cauldron will follow along with you in a containment chamber of its own and though it initially resembles a cottage...should the contraption chain grow bigger (and it will!) the cottage will also increase in size.
        Daisy Chain (100CP)
        Interested in large scale alchemy? Well, between this and a core reactor, you'll have yourself a veritable alchemy workshop. Granted, in reality this just sets up a series of mini cauldrons which will automatically adopt specific arrangements to facilitate more complex, multi-tiered synthesis reactions but it'll boost your synthesis rates immensely, and ensure that easier recipes won't fail! Of course...you could have each cauldron act autonomously but really they work best in unison with every other unit. Due to the number of cauldrons created, a large part of the containment chamber is occupied by cauldrons as they move about and get down to business. Thankfully, you can still move about and organize the cauldrons though they're a fair bit more autonomous than before. Each cauldron seems to exhibit the same effects as your original cauldron, and it isn't out of the realm of possibility to add more cauldrons though it'll be a time consuming process.
        The Vortex (100CP)
        The amount of energy required to keep this going will be tremendous, but if you toss anything into there it will blend. Instead of functioning like a batch system, the Cauldron operates continually, and will actively remember the last effect from the last ingredient which was put in. It's also possible for it to store an effect, but this requires you to have a constant supply of the reagent necessary to provide that effect. A cauldron useful for expert alchemists, one should take care if this is combined with any other extensive modifications.


-Stone Censer of Reunion (Desolate Era Part II - The Chaosverse) (800CP)
        The original Stone Censer of Reunion was a potent artifact, however this version has been fine tuned to the extreme. Its first effect is that those in the range of its incense enter a state of enlightenment equal to those random moments and epiphanies, except for however long the incense lasts. Which is now forever, meaning it may even be used in a space-time acceleration treasure.
        * Unlimited enlightenment and epiphanies scaling to on your int, knowledge and power




 --- Domain: Facilities: Mundane (7) (47 Perks) --- 




-Advance Processor Fabricator (Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest) (100CP)
        This quantum scale fabricator is focused on producing complex processors and other computer chips. It is able to create quantum computing matrices including seven state processing chipsets.


-Auto-Factory (Starbound) (100CP)
        A room full of various arms and other tools, this factory is designed to be programmed with the blueprints for any item that you know how to create, allowing for raw materials to be fed in from the ship's storage, and be turned into whatever items are programmed into the factory. Warning: Only items that run on purely mechanical / scientific principles can be made here. If something requires magic or more esoteric energies to be created, it will require your personal touch to actually make, though individual parts could still be crafted by the factory. Can't make items bigger than the room itself, though it can build the pieces for you to put together yourself later.
        * 100cp because a 1 module ship costs that


-Data Khala (Starcraft Protoss) (100CP)
        While psionics are powerful, sometimes a technological solution is needed. This is the Templars solution to a technological Khala. A powerful digital Khala that links together all the different Purifier units. You have your own version of this. With this, all of your computers and AI can communicate with each other over cosmic distances with zero lag time. Instantaneous information sharing. As the centre of this digital Khala you can link into, and communicate with, it too.


-Laboratorium (Light of Terra DLC 3 - A Grand Day Out) (100CP)
        Ancient cogitators, arrays of auspex systems, and volume upon volume of documentation supply an Adept with the tools and information necessary to capably analyse a recovered technological artefact.
        * Extremely high tech lab for studying artefacts. From Warhammer 40k.


-Research and Development Center (Mass Effect Andromeda) (100CP)
        The R&D center is integral to the Initiative's colonization efforts in the Heleus cluster. There is one in every settlement. As you increase the amount of information you discover, the more you will be able to progress and discover in the Research section. And Development allows a user to build any object that you have the blueprints/plans for and resources to make it. If you have a ship, you can choose to integrate this into the ship. While the R&D center is initially limited to making things that are man portable, with the appropriate upgrades, that may change. After all, Remnant Vaults have such interesting technology...
        Post Jump, you can choose to have the R&D center be integrated with your Warehouse, have it be placed somewhere mid jump, or even have it be connected to a robot of some sort for mobile crafting purposes.


-Starting HUB | Satisfactorio Builder (Satisfactory-factorio Gauntlet) (100CP)
        Starting HUB (100CP)
        Instead of starting with a box containing only the most critical components of the HUB, you start with a prefab base in a box. Set it up anywhere, and as long as you empty it out you can move it around. This base has a craft bench, equipment workshop, a molecular analysis machine, an RTG that produces a small amount of power perpetually, and a spot for the research dropship to land. In addition, it has a rack with a few standard storage boxes and a bunk room big enough for all of you. You start with all recipes that you get from completing the HUB in-game unlocked. Respawns monthly. In addition, you can keep this and drop it at your starting location in future Jumps, if you want.
        Satisfactorio Builder (0CP)
        The buildy gun from Satisfactory. It can place down buildings and other artificial structures, either from parts or premade. It can deconstruct buildings and other artificial objects, either breaking them down or storing them whole. It can give orders to logistic or construction systems that you are authorized on (including the ones from this Gauntlet.) It can configure the settings of machines. It has an internal inventory that can be upgraded (to a limited extent until you leave the Gauntlet.)
        Always fully charged, can be upgraded in other ways, automatically imports into similar handheld stuff, and syncs up with other inventory/storage Perks, Items, and items. If lost, stolen, or broken, it will respawn in an appropriate and safe place immediately, even during the Gauntlet.
        * Builder is required to make use of the HUB, it is also a free item.


-Weapons Lab (Starbound) (100CP)
        A lab full of analysis and test equipment, aimed specifically at deciphering and improving deadly weaponry. You can use this lab to analyze any weapons that you come across, and given time, can figure out how to isolate and combine the different features of the weapons into other weaponry you create. Comes with a melee and firing range for testing out any weapons as well.
        * 100cp because a 1 module ship costs that


-Workshop (Bubblegum Crisis) (100CP)
        Do you need tools? You have ALL the tools. Using this, you can effectively build and/or repair any damn thing in BGC, though constructing orbital shuttles might take a while. Never mind getting a hold of the plans. Can act as an independent location or as an upgrade/attachment to Canyon Garage or Underground Hideout.


-Workshop (Personal Reality Supplement v1.3) (100CP)
        Each purchase of this adds to your Personal Reality, a Workshop needed to perform a specific type of craft, which is to be specified when purchase is made. It comes with a basic set of tools and supplies. Good for fixing or creating all sorts of things, although any complex parts or nonstandard supplies will have to be brought in from outside. Additional purchases can add different types of Workshops to your Personal Reality or expand existing ones. Anything built in one of those workshops is fiat backed to be restored to its original condition within 48 hours if damaged or destroyed
        * Grants fiat backing to anything constructed within


-Bat Computer (Injustice) (200CP)
        Now this is a must for the enterprising superhero a supercomputer composed of some of the most bleeding-edge hardware on the planet, capable of hacking into the vast majority of systems worldwide. It can process and transmit information far faster than nearly any other, and it has a number of forensic programs built in. Perhaps most notable is its capacity to analyze and reverse-engineer nearly any substance within the space of a few minutes and it will eventually prove its ability to do so when it provides the insurgency with the secret to the Regime's nanotech pills.


-INFINITE FUN SPACE WORLDS (The Culture Minds) (200CP)
        A numinous selection of metamathical simulated universes which can be indistinguishable from the real thing. You can live out any fantasies you like in them, from the most realistic slices of life to wildly outrageous war simulations, to varying degrees of controlled narrative or pure mechanistic outcome, and to realistic or magical physics or metaphysics. Or, simply conduct experiments and sims for science and personal enlightenment? These many virtual universes do not consume any of your personal processing ability or memory to maintain.
        * Where else can you find infinite simulated universes that you can fully control that can simulate magic and normal physics perfectly.
        * Might not be easy to use for anyone without massive computational skill, this thing is meant to be used by Minds on ships which are basically very very powerful AIs.


-Robo Bunker (Dragon Ball GT) (200CP)
        What kind of man of science would you be without your very own lab? Hidden underground in your starting world, this high tech laboratory has everything you need to get started on your robotic weapons of mass destruction. While the facility can function as a normal lab, as well as having basic living quarters and strong security measures, it works best towards designing and manufacturing androids or robots on the individual scale, increasing the quality of these personalised products significantly and cutting the time and resources required to make them to just below half the usual amount.


-Ultimate Research Lab (Danganronpa) (200CP)
        You gain a single research lab corresponding to the ultimate ability of you or a companion of your choice. It is a room filled with everything necessary to hone your talents, with the most high-tech equipment for your profession available. Examples include a complete library of notable criminal cases for the Ultimate Detective or a tennis court with robotic opponents of varying difficulties for the Ultimate Tennis Pro.
        This will appear in Hope's Peak during the killing game, but will be an extension of your Cosmic Warehouse in future jumps.
        * Combos with Izuru Kamakura (from the same jump) to cover anything which can fall under talent with canonical examples including engineering, invention, martial arts, luck and clairvoyance.
        * Perk text may suggest updating when imported into a new jump.
        * May not contain anything if either Super Highschool Level or Izuru Kamakura from the same jump is not purchased.
        * Most high-tech equipment available suggests that it updates to both settings and your own technical abilities.


-Workshop (Samurai Jack) (200CP)
        A small base filled with all the equipment you'll need to work. This lab can be used for your choice of scientific or magical research.
        * Extremely open ended toolkit, it can probably scale to any level. Comes from a space age anime jump.
        * Works for magic
* Maybe note that it can be bought twice, instead that it works with magic (it does say it has magical research)?
* The bought twice is already factored into the price. 


-Workshop (Smash Up) (200CP)
        A well-appointed workshop, overflowing with brass, vacuum tubes, and specialized tools. Inspiration comes more easily within these walls.


-Workshop/3D Fabricator (GUNNM) (200CP)
        Powered tools for cyborg disassembly and repair. Bulky diagnostic computer, ten kilograms of miscellaneous spare parts, very rare compact 3D fabricator capable of milling custom components and printing or repairing circuitry. Free Rocket Hammer


-Advanced Laboratory (Green Lantern) (300CP)
        One of the most advanced on Earth, at that. This is a state-of-the-art lab and workshop, filled with the finest equipment money can buy, uniquely set up to allow you to work on just about any branch of science you wish to. Be it building a car or examining an alien body, you won't find facilities better than the ones here, that's for sure.


-Crafting Stations (Fallout 4) (300CP)
        You have each of the main crafting stations (capable of making armor, weapons, and chems) in your Warehouse; each one greatly simplifies the process of crafting or modifying items. In addition, each one also seems to have the filler items that you'd need; the various chemicals and parts that aren't a significant or expensive part of whatever you're crafting. They can't provide anything supernatural or rare, but small amounts of metal for a new gun mod or some dye is fine.


-Holocron Crafting Station (Star Wars The Old Republic) (300CP)
        This crafting station allows you to impart any skill (or set of skills) you have into a holocron, which others may use to learn the skill(s). Requires 8 hours of meditation for each year's worth of training imparted. When used, the holocron increases the user's skills as though you were training them yourself. Both the creation process and the user's education include the effects of all teaching perks you possessed at the time of the holocron's creation when measuring the rate at which they occur. You may place any restriction you can name on who can access your holocrons, and those restrictions will be enforced by Jump Fiat. You may 'update' an already-created holocron to use your new current set of training perks, or modify the restrictions you've placed on it, by bringing it back to the crafting station and meditating with it for 1 hour, modified by teaching perks. Your holocrons may include any subject that can reasonably be described as being 'taught', even if it is not necessarily a 'skill' per se, such as philosophy. You may combine any number of lessons into the same holocron, and choose the exact manner (order, relative emphasis, and so forth) in which they are taught.
        * Literally crafts Holocrons


-Project Destroyer of Worlds (Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1) (300CP)
        What if a person could be made better? If they could possess the density of lead with the volatility of cesium? Think of the power one could have if infused with the properties of materials. Enter this particle infusion chamber. When a person goes in, programming in specifics of how a person should be effected when inserting one or more materials for the infusion process will see them come out with potentially new properties or powers based on the material. Whether they look like they have pieces replaced by these materials or simply possess the properties is up to you, but now there is an answer to Captain America. Become the Destroyer of Worlds.
* Given some of the materials in the Forge, this perk feels really OP, is 300CP enough as a price?
* Pretty unique though, plus not too op, we have some 300 perks that are way stronger than this, at least this needs you to get the materials.


-Simulation Room (World Seed) (300CP)
        One important device any spaceship captain should have in their arsenal, or any militaristic leader at all, for that matter, is a simulation room. With them, it is possible to train against enemy forces all day long in a nigh-infinite amount of configurations and situations, an invaluable preparation for whenever the real thing happens, at least as long as you have accumulated enough data of what it is you need to fight and analyzed their strengths and weaknesses. But it is exactly this problem that the simulation room you have in your possession has solved. As long as you have experienced something personally, you simply need to link your mind with the simulation device, and it will quickly and accurately extrapolate from that information and manage to create a simulation of it that is at least 99.9% accurate, even if you only looked at an enemy fleet and never actually saw its combat capabilities, only growing more accurate as you gain more information. Any amount of people can use this room, its dimensions expanding and contracting as needed and new spots popping up in the same way, and this extrapolation can be used on anyone connecting their mind to it. By default, this is a warehouse attachment, but you can place it wherever you want in the real world.


-Advanced Lab (Timespinner) (400CP)
        A high-tech laboratory, kitted out with everything needed for high-end scientific exploration. It has an assembly line that can be set-up to transform raw materials into machinery via set blueprints or break down trash into raw materials, vats for cloning and developing living tissue, and offices and workspaces for general development. It is controlled and powered by a central energy core, which also doubles as a supercomputer. It can be accessed via a door in your warehouse, and can be physically inserted into a Jump and accessed directly. Finally, special spacio-temporal support buffers allow it to survive in the event of the universe ceasing to exist, and it will emergency teleport you within itself in such an event, until it is safe to emerge.


-Augmentation Suite (Generic Cyberpunk) (400CP)
        Not everybody can build a better future, but the advance of technology has made it more than possible to build a better man. These tools include those required to both maintain, service, construct, and even design or install nearly any cybernetic implant or device imaginable. Of special note is the high end fabrication capabilities that can let you throw together such devices within minutes to hours, allowing you to respond to your needs on the fly. An installation suite includes the medically sterile space necessary to perform even the most complicated or delicate operation involved, and all the requisite tools. Whether you're setting up shop in a professional manner or servicing the more shady types out of the back of an expanded bus for dirty money, you have everything you need or could want. You may choose to have all of this connected to or fused with your warehouse. Everything replenishes and is restored in a day if destroyed, and you have a limitless supply of materials barring anything truly extraordinary which will require you to provide yourself.


-Auto Shop (My Life As A Teenage Robot) (400CP)
        This item is some kind of repair shop owned or otherwise freely accessible by you. The facilities here are able to repair any Mechanical device within 8 hours, including yourself, and can easily and quickly install any upgrades or technologies. And more so this shop is able to 'reformat' any mechanical or technological device, altering its aesthetics in any possible way and changing its basic form. When reformatting you can also have Mechanical capabilities adjusted, altering them in a give and take fashion. The shop can be staffed by anyone/thing you want or fully automated so long as this nature doesn't provide noticeable advantage beyond the item's function


-Candyland (Fantastic Four) (400CP)
        What is a scientist without a worthy lab? Yours is, thankfully. Indeed, few laboratories in the world could be found that would be able to beat this place. You have a huge lab setup, probably spanning multiple floors of a huge building or a truly ridiculously sized compound on the ground, and when it comes to Science of any and all kinds, this place is as close to nirvana as it gets. It doesn't even matter what kind of science you pursue, as the facilities here cover every single one of them. From biology to advanced astrophysics to psychology, this place has the very, absolute finest facilities possible to get, millions, potentially billions of dollars worth of equipment. The quantities you have here of things depends on their rarity in the outside world, but you have an unlimited supply of everything 'common', including live bodies of generic non-people and animals, all up to specifications. From there the rarer something is the fewer samples you have of it, but no matter if it's rare samples of bacteria, radioactive metals or anything in between, this place is bound to have some of it, enough to make something good. Everything restocks, again depending on rarity, but even the rarest samples are back in a couple months. In future worlds too, everything here, including the databanks in the computers, updates to equal levels in the local world.


-Factory 436-1337 (Smash Up) (400CP)
        Robots building robots? How perverse. This repurposed Boeing plant can operate at all hours of the night and day, churning out robots of any size, function or design you may wish. Automatically updates with local technology in new settings.


-Fringe Institute Fab-Unit 20,000 (World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression) (400CP)
        A marvel of technological wonder, and an outright Wonder at that. This device can take mundane objects and combine them together whilst maintaining the best of the two items. When used the items merge together so that it keeps the chosen properties of each, though without stacking redundant attributes. Ex. A computer chip and a brand new superconductor would produce a new computer chip designed with the superconductor already in place. However, two nearly identical computer chips wouldn't make a computer chip twice as good as the originals.


-Industrial Fabber (Schlock Mercenary Rebuild) (400CP)
        A massive fabber that is used for industrial applications like building starships. It can't be hosted in a spaceship, but could help you to build your own if fed raw material from space-rocks and such. It is capable of building annie plants if given sufficient time. It comes with a full tech database of all publicly available technologies, and will update to add any new publicly available technologies in future Jumps.
        * Can be used to build battleplates read: spaceships meant to tank relativistic orbital bombardments to save planets.


-Laboratory (Ben 10 0.1) (400CP)
        Of course you need somewhere to work, you buffoon! What, do you think you were going to make some of the greatest wonders in the universe in some busybody's toolshed?! Ahem. This is a fully stocked Galvan laboratory with all the tools and resources needed to do research and development. Subatomic observation platforms, computers with exabytes worth of storage, and so forth. It's a generalist sort of facility but there's room to add to it later if you wish to specialize.


-Launderer System (No More Heroes) (400CP)
        You gain a new thing to place in your warehouse, and though you don't exactly know how it works the instruction booklet says it can construct beam katanas of all different styles and usefulness if given the right components or if you don't have those, shoving the right raw ingredients in enough quantity to just manufacture the damn things. With enough technical knowledge, you will be able to discard the manual
        * A Beam Katana is basically a Lightsaber from Star Wars


-Magic IDE (Generic Videogame Developer) (400CP)
        IDE that can use any programming language and can offer improvements as well as picking out error, can make duplicate code that is compatible with different OS, and has the ability to slowly finish a program predefined by Jumper with time scaling with complexity, although its limited by hardware capability and writes the code as well as user would normally, except taking longer.


-Nanite Fabrication Table (Stargate Atlantis) (400CP)
        This table has an indented, flat surface roughly the size of a coffin. It is specifically designed to assemble and program/reprogram nanite-based technology without needing clean-room conditions; if you have the right designs it could easily produce something like a nanite plague or medical nanites, and eventually produce self-replicating nanites which became the Asuran-form Replicators. However, the knowledge you will need to design and program any of these constructs must be sought elsewhere: this is merely the tool, not the craftsman.


-Orbital Refinery (Hive Queen Quest) (400CP)
        This ship is roughly a mile wide and comes stock with all the tools required to mine and refine raw ore into all manner of useable machines though its capacity is rather low, only able to produce two ships a month at most, should refined materials be fed into it the speed would likely increase somewhat while it could also be used to refine ore into ingots at an even faster rate if building machines is not required. Should you wish you could feed any scrap metal you may come across to refine it into useable materials. The refineries major downfall is that it has no ftl capability and must be towed into place, becoming largely stationary.


-Pyramid (Assassin's Creed Odyssey) (400CP)
        A device used for computing possible futures and observing memories of the past. When a future is calculated by the relic, it provides information about the steps that need to be taken and the events that need to happen for the future to be realized. Lesser minds can end up overwhelmed by the information provided from this. The various triangles that make up its surface can be removed and held by individuals. With this version, the memories of those holding or in close contact with a triangle can be read by someone using the 'base' of the pyramid, even from a great distance, and future calculations can still be performed, even when a triangle is missing, though the more triangles are missing, the less precise the calculated future is. All triangles can be summoned back to the base instantly if desired.


-Snake Fortress (Grant Morrison's 18 Days) (400CP)
        Rather less 'glorious' than most items on this list. This is an incredibly strong, unbelievably advanced fortress, quite possibly the most advanced Yajnatek citadel ever built. Chock-full of laboratories for all kinds of research, auto-generated test subjects, with a gigantic arsenal of defenses and traps and guarded by a legion of Naga Warriors, it's the ideal place to conduct any and all blasphemous, heretical experiment and studies one might be in the mood to engage in.
        What might help is that the power of your benefactor makes it so that it's really, staggeringly unlikely and difficult for this place to be found by anyone who would be hostile to you, be they man or god. Not impossible, but... yeah. On the other hand anyone who wants a favor or to conduct business can get here as easily as any other place. It also looks like a giant iron cobra... the whole fortress. Because of course it does.


-The Recycling Towers (Nier: Automata) (400CP)
        The Recycling Towers are a set of ten large, floating metal structures. Each one is quite massive, containing many floors and enough room for tens of large robot soldiers to be in. While they would certainly do well as heavily armoured, flying troop transports, their real use is in the gathering and reconstruction of matter. Each Tower can suck up physical objects or material from beneath it, gathering them and then reconstructing the matter to a more preferable form inside the Tower. The tower's creation abilities are not absolute but it is still able to create almost any of the machine life forms in this world, which can be quite complicated, and it may be possible to program more complex instructions into the fortresses.


-Worthy Workshop (Girl Genius SB) (400CP)
        The tradesman needs the right tools, don't you know? More than that, they need the labs! You have a full set of labs, for chemical, biological, mechanical experiments, as well as any other kinds you might need. Abominable, perhaps?
        These are some of the most elaborate, extensive laboratories and workshops in the world, with vast arrays of instruments and tools of the finest make, an unlimited supply of test subjects, and huge amounts of spare parts, reagents, books and journals... everything a spark needs to get going. You have just about any and all parts and reagents you might need, even things incredibly rare like water from the Dyne, and the absolute latest in all parts, of course.
        Furthermore, any and all properties you have that can support them all develop similar labs and workshops, providing you a virtually unlimited collection of spaces to work from so you're never, ever left unable to tinker to your heart's content.


-A Hidden Base (Arpeggio of Blue Steel) (600CP)
        This tropical island houses a secret facility with all the facilities of a modern shipyard: underground docks for submarines or other submersible craft to enter by, comfortable living quarters and rooms for planning operations, stockpiles of nanomaterials, an underground mine for extracting raw materials, and even a fantastic beach. While it seems idyllic, it is far from defenceless: concealed turrets, Klein field generators, missile tubes and more lie in wait for any attacker. Its defences can be overwhelmed eventually, however, so I wouldn't rely on them against a sophisticated foe. Expended consumables, like nanomaterials, resupply on a weekly basis. This island imports into a suitably remote position in a tropical ocean in each jump.


-Cybertronian Forge (Transformers) (600CP)
        Somehow a good portion of your warehouse is now a mini cybertronian factory. This automatic factory prints out Cybertronium, a material that Transformers bodies are made out of. This is a room temperature superconductor and is the basis of all Cybertronian technology. It also functions as a 3D printer, but its programming is blank ready for input.


-Handy Workshop (Satisfactory-factorio Gauntlet) (600CP)
        This Equipment Workshop provides you with the tools and materials needed to upgrade any equipment you have. However, you must have a well-defined, finite end goal for the equipment, and you need to be undisturbed while using it. Extensive goals require extensive amounts of time, and you might be better served looking for better materials than brute-forcing a far-reaching goal with limited materials.
        You can only get materials that are duplicates of some you already have, in infrastructure or a system you already have, or just in storage or on your person. Other people using this only get the tools, not the free materials. Can be installed in your Warehouse or attached to an Imported property in future Jumps. If destroyed while Imported, reverts to being part of the Warehouse.


-Legion Fabrication Unit (World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression) (600CP)
        The end-point for many Genius' mass production needs is simply the beginning for you. This is a Wonder able to build other Wonders, a warehouse sized factory that accepts blueprints and raw materials and through the wonders of 3D printing, creates the finished product of whole cloth by the dozens per hour as long as it has the materials to use as a base. This facility comes with a default Air/Ground/Navy production of military automatons.
        If you have Big Think they can be controlled by child AI of Big Think itself, at no risk to Big Think, to grant a huge upgrade in the self-automation of the automatons. Even better is that simplistic systems can be turned to another purpose. If the world has non-repeatable phenomena, such as magical devices in an otherwise non-magical world or technology so far beyond the norm as to be called 'extremely improbable', this system can analyze the structure and create a Wonder of roughly equal ability and function.
        If you have A Correlation of Constants Between Physical Reality and Wondrous Artifice Creation then this ideal can be realized via the systems here as well. Allowing all Wonders created by this system to become simply mundane, though at a size and sudden need for fuel. For example a plasma pistol that could easily melt tank armored plate would find that it would need a massive battery and be around the size of an RPG.


-Manufactory (Revelation Space) (600CP)
        When lighthuggers and habitats need to repair themselves, the large-scale manufactories are where the parts are designed and produced. This manufactory is roughly on par with that of a well-to-do Glitter Band habitat, and on its own is the size of several skyscrapers packed tightly together. Running at peak efficiency, it's capable of assembling 1,000 tons of raw material into finished products per minute provided, of course, you have the right kinds of raw materials, correct blueprints to assemble them into, and a logistics chain to keep it all working smoothly. In the hands of an inefficient human, it might top out at 100 tons/minute. It is incapable of atomic transmutation and having to 'crack' raw matter into a different type will slow everything down a bit (eg: throwing in methane (CH4) to crack into carbon and hydrogen, when you need the carbon to make diamond, rather than using pure carbon to begin with). It is capable of producing nanotech (such as quickmatter) at a much smaller rate, owing to the processes involved. The Manufactory comes pre-installed with blueprints for just about any item in common use in Yellowstone space; you'll have to obtain prohibited or classified blueprints for yourself. You will have to manually configure and program it to work with any unusual materials.


-Omnium (Overwatch) (600CP)
        Oh, how interesting. You seem to have come into the possession of your own personal Omnium. These self-improving automated robotic factories are the source of the omnic population of the world and were very nearly the instrument of humanity's ruin during the first Crisis. You may have the factory create omnics for you as is its purpose, though you will need to supply the materials necessary for doing so. You may also fully customize the appearance, personality, intelligence level, and capabilities of your creations though if the specifications are too far removed from basic omnics, you will need to supply the necessary designs for them.


-Research Laboratory (Warhammer 40k: T'au Empire) (600CP)
        This Research Laboratory is is four stories high and covers about 100 acres of ground, and includes all of the most advanced mundane technologies of the T'au, with small sections being dedicated to various subfields in Physics, Materials Science, Chemistry, Biology, Engineering, and Computer Science, while still being modular in design and easily upgradeable or repurposed to various other fields. It will manage itself and churn out research into various mundane technologies on its own, though you can direct it to specific purposes, and will manage its own staffing, though you can hire or fire staff as you please (within limits, don't expect to hire an entire sept to work for this lab). But moreover, this laboratory has some unique properties. Firstly, no research you perform will result in catastrophic destruction, by accident or by sabotage. No nanobots you research here will result in a Grey Goo scenario, no virus will mutate into a global pandemic, no dinosaurs will be unleashed on the public as a staffer flees with their DNA. If such research would normally result in such an issue, your staff will find that their research just stalls, failing to progress at all but not resulting in harm. And secondly, if you deign to perform research in this laboratory personally, then you, and your staff, will find your research accelerated by an order of magnitude as research cycles blaze by and prototype units roll out of machine shops far more quickly than possible, so long as you personally spend at least 40 man-hours a week performing research of some kind, with lesser boosts available if you spend less time contributing to the labs productivity.


-Warchive (Revelation Space) (600CP)
        An ignorant fool would call the warchive an arsenal, 'a place to store weapons', as evidenced by the quantity of guns displayed on the walls of this room, but it's also so very much more. The warchive contains a coffin-sized fabricator and an advanced database containing every personal weapon that humanity has developed in this universe, in its thousands of years of violence. From a combat knife to an ack-am launcher to a camouflaged assassin's needler, this fabricator can not only manufacture any handheld weapon it has the schematics for, but it can also merge and customize their functions, appearances, programming and ergonomics to any user's vague, general or very specific requirements. It comes equipped with a knowledgeable gamma-level personality to interpret your requests and offer suggestions. You'll get to specify the personality, so you don't get annoyed by it. The warchive will automatically acquire the blueprints of any weapons you currently possess or acquire to add to its collection, with the stipulation that it cannot reproduce enchantments or other added magical effects, and you may have to supply a bit of raw material and some of the rarer components yourself (like antimatter or setting-specific materials like kryptonite, eezo or uru). The warchive takes up a room which may be placed in your warehouse, a large starship or another property. Naturally, you can restrict access to the warchive.


-Workshop of the Future (Generic Cyberpunk) (600CP)
        What you could make if only you had the tools. It's a lamentation that you'll never find yourself making ever again. This absolute masterpiece of a workspace is large enough that even a megacorp wouldn't find it lacking, either in space or capability, capable of hosting every pursuit or project you care to imagine and often many of those at once. Most unique however is the impossibly nuanced automation that has been worked into it's countless systems and utilities. Even the most exacting genius or craftsman would find no reason to fault letting the systems here do the work for them, allowing them to focus entirely on pushing the boundaries and leaving grunt work to the machines. These systems effectively share your crafting skills and abilities including the effects of perks. If you've purchased the Augmentation Suite and/or Keys to the Matrix then they are seamlessly integrated, and with the Personal Arm Computer the entire sight could be managed trivially from it's interface. May be either an actual facility or attached to your warehouse. Comes with a limitless stock of raw materials and resources barring the truly extraordinary, same as the Augmentation Suite. Whatever tools or functions it lacks can easily be built with what is here if needed. Never suffer for tools again.


-UAC Mars Facility (DOOM 3 V1.0) (800CP)
        One of the most advanced scientific research stations in the solar system, the UAC's Mars facilities work on everything from energy production and terraforming to Archaeology and teleportation. It is one of the pinnacles of human achievement and now, it is yours. Or at least, a copy of it is - perhaps one far enough away from the original that it's safe from the coming demonic invasion?
        Coming with a full complement of (mostly) competent staff as well as a wide variety of interesting technologies, the facility now operates under your command. Whether you decide to take a more active hand in their research or simply leave them to their own interests, they're guaranteed to come up with interesting ideas over time - usually in areas involving physics, weapons development, and so on. In future worlds, you'll likewise become the owner of a large, productive center of scientific learning, though it doesn't need to be on Mars as such.




 --- Domain: Facilities: Magical (8) (57 Perks) --- 




-Alchemist's Laboratory (Overlord - The Series ) (100CP)
        A fully fitted and supplied alchemist's laboratory ready for your use. It comes with the highest quality supplies and equipment required to make magical potions, allowing you to make potions to emulate the effect of any spell you know that could be reasonably made into a potion via alchemy (assuming you know alchemy, at least). The equipment will automatically upgrade itself relative to your own personal skill level, so the more skilled you are the better it will be to reflect that. Reagents for common potions restock themselves automatically on a regular basis.
        The100 CP version includes the reagents for rare and much higher quality potions that will restock themselves, and additionally a store-front will be added to the front of your laboratory, allowing you to profit from your efforts. It also comes with a sales clerk and an alchemist of exceptional talent if still within reasonable limits (read: not Realm of Heroes or Level One Hundred) whom will produce and sell potions for you. You get potions for free, and get a cut of all profits the store makes. The laboratory, sales clerk, and alchemist will follow you jump to jump, although the clerk and alchemist aren't the same people jump-to-jump (unless you purchase the Guild Base option, in which case they can be if they are part of the Guild Base). No one will question the presence of this store or the potions it makes, even in places or worlds where it would be highly irregular. You get to choose where the laboratory is located in this and future jumps.


-Alchemy Workshop (Endless Legend) (100CP)
        Build into a wagon, this full scale workshop allows for scientific research in the field, and provides all the tools the aspiring researcher needs to learn about the world they are in. Just don't blow yourself up or blind anyone, ok?
        * Not many of that workshops are mobile


-Auto-smelter (Azeroth) (100CP)
        This Auto-Smelter will smelt down any raw ore placed inside it into high quality ingots. This smelter is completely hands free, except for actually placing the ore inside. For further incentive, if you purchased The Mine you will be given a group of magical constructs who will mine your ore, place it in the Auto-Smelter, then sort out the finished product. They can not be used for anything outside of their primary functions stated above.


-House of the Witch (Fate/Legends - Empires of Antiquity) (100CP)
        Every young witch's favourite birthday present, at least until they know how to make it themselves. This small house is rather rudimentary when it comes to living necessities but quite filled out in regards to potion making. Not only does it have a high quality set of tools and appliances towards creating potions, poisons and designing magical rituals, it also comes with a weekly replenishing stock of low to mid range potions in the pantry. From youth restoring drinks, potions to plump or slim down the form, some love potions and even a few useful for combat potions that can temporarily improve strength and speed. The house also always has a fresh batch on pancakes ready on the stove, covered in your choice of delicious topping


-A Barrier of Perspective (Touhou Forbidden Hermit) (200CP)
You have an extensive understanding of the arts required to create Gensokyo in the first place. Gensokyo’s boundary works off of perspective – one could travel between two similar barriers (such as between Gensokyo and the Lunar Capital) without ever leaving Gensokyo, but at the same time if they were to ever try to fly to the edges they’d “see” themselves travelling great distances while not actually moving at all, only discovering how little they moved when they turn around. You could use this easily to craft your own sealed dimensions.


-Alchemy Machine (Spiral Knights) (200CP)
        A personal Variation of the machine you'll come to see all over the cradle. This one allows for a degree of experimentation that none of the other machines will, and is capable of accepting a great variety of materials without taking any damage. You'll be able to tweak existing recipes, or even come up with new ones all together with enough time. Who knows, you might stumble on something good.


-Alchemy Workshop (Unmodded Minecraft) (200CP)
        This small room has only a workbench and a chest that hold a miscellany of reagents and alchemy supplies. The chest will provide a small but steady supply of glass vials, water, and nether wart, the things which form the basis of all Minecraft potions. Occasionally when opened the chest will also have a small amount of glowstone, redstone, or gunpower for use. Post-jump, the chest will update to provide a similar supply of anything a world's alchemy absolutely requires to get started, along with small amounts of random low-level ingredients.


-Artifact Forge (Azeroth) (200CP)
        This forge grants you every appearance in the game of your Artifact Weapon and allows you to alter the appearance of your weapon at any time. In future Jumps it will allow you to alter the function of your weapon at any time. Turning swords into spears or axes into daggers. I'll even allow you to use it to change a pistol into a rifle, or something similar. The forge will also serve as a medium allowing you to more easily enchant and create powerful weapons which you can imbue with powerful magical effects.


-Castle Jumper (Marvel Magic) (200CP)
        What is the point of living if you don't do it in style? Certainly, you know the importance of aesthetics even in the face of practicality... but that does not mean that something can't be both stylish and practical. You are the proud owner of a large european castle. It's practically straight out of a storybook, having stone walls, great towers -- hell, the thing even has a moat. However, despite its ancient appearance, it is fully updated to the modern times. Possessing everything from standard amenities such as running water and electricity to a state-of-the-art security system and laboratories. The way you live should make a statement, a fact that you seem to understand very well.


-Delfire Forge (Ravenwood) (200CP)
        Actually three items. A single, moderately powerful orb of delfire, a metal frame that can store an orb of delfire and allow the one that holds it to use the orb without being a kiln, and a large furnace that, if you plug the frame into it while it holds an orb of delfire, can be used to treat metals with arcane energy while also acting as a forge.


-Portable Workshop (Divinity - Original Sin) (200CP)
        Being constantly on the move, Source Hunters are forced to find ways to ensure they have the tools of their craft even when far from their headquarters. This set of three small, metal charms are relics of an age past that were confiscated and put to better use. By pulling one off the chain that binds them, an easy act when one actually desires it, the holder can have what they require. Place the charm on the ground and a Forge springs into existence, hot and ready to be used. Or a campfire crackling cheerfully and ready to warm the air. The final charm is a Workbench, which includes a grinding wheel and all the small tools a budding alchemist might need to construct grenades, arrows, or even the smaller magical charms. By touching the small symbol etched into each, they will revert back to their charm form and hop back onto the chain in an instant. Should you accidently lose one or be forced to leave one behind, it will reappear on the chain at the next full moon


-Crafting Stations (Terraria - Journey's End) (300CP)
        Crafting Stations Stations that are used with your ability to craft items. Each of them is easily collapsible with your inventory ability. Cost is for advanced option.
        Basic Comes with a workbench [any style], furnace, iron or lead anvil, and three of the following crafting stations: Alchemy Table, Sawmill, Loom, Cooking Pot, Dye Vat, Heavy Work Bench, Keg, Teapot, Class Kiln, Ice Machine, Living Loom, Solidifier, Extractinator
        Improved Comes with a workbench [any style], hellforge, iron or lead anvil, demon or crimson altar, and four of the crafting stations listed above or in the following list: Tinkerer's Workshop, Imbuing Station, Bone Welder, Honey Dispenser, Sky Mill
        Advanced Comes with a workbench [any style], adamantite or titanium forge, mythril or orichalcum anvil, demon or crimson altar, and five of the crafting stations listed above or in the following list: Crystal Ball, Autohammer, Blend-O-Matic, Meat Grinder, Decay Chamber, Flesh Cloning Vat, Steampunk Boiler, Lihzahrd Furnace


-Enchanted Anvil (Geneforge) (300CP)
        A powerful artifact which allows the crafting of enchanted equipment, so long as one has the right materials. Normally they are effectively immovable and thus bound to a specific location, this one is easily moved, as far as large heavy anvils go.


-Mystical Forge (Jade Empire) (300CP)
        You have obtained a forge capable of creating gems, as well as upgrading any of your weapons to their fullest potential. The staff known as Golden Star can become Tien's Justice, the sword known as Fortune's Favorite can become the Demon Sword. Furthermore, this forge can upgrade your own weapons, increasing the skill it takes to use them, but enhancing their abilities by 50% ... provided you are willing to think of a cool name and backstory for them. The forge is a stickler for tradition.


-Nine Elements Cauldron (Desolate Era Part I - The Three Realms) (300CP)
        A cauldron that is typically used to melt down treasures for their elemental essence, so that someone can then repurpose them into forging a new treasure that is even stronger than the many that were melted down. Unlike others, however, this one seems to be able to melt down items of any level, and can remember the traits of any treasures it melts down and apply them to other items.


-Ritual Room (Highschool DxD) (300CP)
        It's a little difficult to practice complex magical formulas in public, so you came prepared. This is a room styled to your preferred magic system of choice, and all magic you personally perform within this room will enjoy both greater efficiency in mana and greater power. Also comes with spooky robes and basic ritual equipment and reagents for free.


-Swordsmith's Hut (Fate/Legends - Land of the Rising Sun) (300CP)
        A bounded field manifested by only the greatest smiths in the land. To make a blade, you no longer need some massive static forge or a complement of sturdy tools. Your workshop remains with you at all times, as much a part of your being as the hands with which you make your art. This magical field you possess allows you to integrate crafting tools and structures that you possess into a bounded field, letting you manifest them at will. This may appear as the structures appearing from nowhere or as overlaying the effects on the existing environment, turning a natural rock bench into a sturdy anvil or a running stream into a fully capable quenching bath for hot steel. Your field is already equipped with all the tools expected of a master swordsmith in this land, as well as potent magical enhancements that improve any crafting efforts made within the field. Creations will be sturdier, sharper, lighter and more adaptable to their wielders even without any skill on your part. You may freely combine new structures and tools into this field, likely mixing them with the existing additions, to continually build on your new everpresent workshop.


-Tower of Sorcerae | Floating Isle | Moving Locations | Arcane | Sorcerae | A Memory Of The Face Of Creation (Lords of the Night - Liches) (300CP)
        Tower of Sorcerae (100CP)
        You have a tower dreamt into reality. Maybe by you, maybe by someone else, but it was never made a concrete and defined thing. It starts out a thing the size of a city block, and thirty stories high. It can be something of stone, or glass, or crystal, or wood. When no one is watching it, it can change its outer facade. Inside it has a basic layout, though you can change that layout whenever it is unobserved by people other than you. Both the inside and out will repair themselves over time, and the tower may slowly shift itself, faster if unobserved, though still slowly.
        The tower echoes any crafting perks you possess, gaining technologies and magics in keeping with the secrets and arts you've seized. You may feed the tower vast quantities of Arcane over time to make it grow. You may make it grow in luxury, making everything inside the tower higher quality over time and more comfortable and beautiful. You may make it grow in utility causing it to grow embedded magical items, and if you have the perks, technological ones. You may make it grow in size, becoming broader or taller or both, or even make it grow inside without growing outside, though that's even more expensive.
        If you make the Tower a bound artifact, all those functions will be enhanced. You can also have it already on legs, or other appropriate mechanisms, so that it can move about. You may import an existing property as your Tower, though if that combination would be especially powerful you must pay an extra 100cp for the privilege.
        Floating Isle (100CP)
        Your Tower flies, and so does a modest amount of land around it. Enough for a small family farm though like with the rest of the tower it's possible to expand this. The weather's always pleasant - the air elementals bound to moving it make sure. They're quick to defend the tower if need be, and there are many permanent unseen servants to invisibly serve guests and do work about the place. And the elementals can push the tower at a decent pace.
        You get about a dozen elder air elemental servants. If killed, they will come back in a day and a night. They can't leave the premise, but otherwise faithfully obey you. They're also surprisingly bright, for elementals at least. You know methods of binding more with the same properties should you require them, though it is neither a fast nor easy process.
        Moving Locations (100CP)
        Your tower has several dozen portals to major population centers, a few smaller towns, and an interesting hidden place of wonder or magic. It has this... for every major plane of existence in the local cosmology, and several of the minor ones. These portals form extensions of the tower on the other end, small buildings or annexes built of the towers essence.
        The portals work automatically for you, and you can key other people to use them. Minions created by your power always count as 'keyed,' unless you've unkeyed them. The portals are near impossible to notice for those not keyed to them, and would require something on the level of epic magic or similar in order to force open. All of the portals are clearly marked as to where they go... but only to those that are actually keyed to using them.
        Arcane (0CP)
        You have traded away Life for a measure of the Arcane, writing the truth of yourself upon the fabric of Reality. It is the Wellspring of Creation, the fire from which things become Possible. It opposes destruction and stagnation. Though it's worth noting that a nova consuming a world full of life and culture doesn't qualify as 'destruction' or 'stagnation.' Merely change, and change is interesting.
        Arcane has a kind of supremacy over mortal magics - not just normal arcane magic either. An Arcane Lich can strip a Dragon of its breath, a Beholder of its gaze, and a Sorcerer of their spells. Such work are the products of specialized Arcana, formal techniques some Liches learn. The converse is not true. An Anti-Magic field does nothing to something fueled with Arcane, while an Arcane Null-Magic Field shuts down mortal magic. An Arcane Item won't show up to Detect Magic, won't be damaged by Disjunction, and generally speaking ignores all such forces.
        In future jumps, it's safe to treat Arcane as a 'higher' force, except when it runs against other explicitly 'higher' reality rewriting forces, such as the Power Cosmic of Marvel or Flame Imperishable of LotR. It can affect the 'lesser forces', and they cannot affect it. On its own, this perk gives you a small pool of Arcane which can be used several ways
        o You can fuel Sorcerae - unstructured magic where you simply create the effect you want.
        o You can transfer it from or to another being or object that can hold it. This can't be used to steal it from another being or to grant the ability to hold or use Arcane to people that cannot already do so. As its own regeneration rate is trivial, storing Arcane energy in prepared crystal and gemstone receptacles ahead of time is the normal method of getting it.
        o Your creative mental energies lets you slowly dream more of it into being. Mechanically your regeneration rate is tied to your Intelligence.
        o You can see Arcane Script, a magical language written in Arcane energies. It has some use in magical items. If you know the script (which you do), you can also write it, though that costs energy. It's possible to drain the Arcane energy used to write the script, erasing what was written.
        o They can develop Arcana, special disciplines fueled by their Arcane energies. Arcane naturally recovers at a snail's pace for all but the most intelligent. More evolved liches gain bonuses to its recovery. However even for superhumanly intelligent spectral liches (the most advanced kind) the recovery rate for Arcane energy is still not terribly quick. (see notes)
        Sorcerae (0CP)
        You can perform Sorcerae, dreaming what you want to happen into being. This is a dangerous power, and the very power the Guild of Wizards claim was used to bring Reality into being. There are ways of sensing its use, and mortal minds were not designed to bear witness to such shapings.
        There are stacking bonuses and penalties to an attempt, but how difficult it will be and how much it will cost is a shifting thing. Taking extra time makes it easier, but also makes finding you easier for those keeping an eye out for such things.
        o Spending extra Arcane can reduce the difficulty.
        o The easiest form of this is dreaming into being an effect you could cast - the known spells of a Sorcerer or the prepared spells of a Wizard. The known spells, that aren't prepared, of a Wizard (and equivalents) are also pretty easy.
        o Any spell you've seen cast, that matches a type you can cast. If you've cast it, you've seen it cast, so these bonuses often go together.
        o Any other effect you've seen is a bit easier, but not much.
        o A spell you can cast, but from an alternative source is a bit easier, but not as much. If you're a specialist wizard, and you somehow learn a forbidden spell, or if you have Cleric levels and decide to copy a Cleric spell, you use this modifier instead
        o A spell from a type you can cast, that you haven't seen, is a little more difficult.
        o A spell that isn't appropriate (Cleric, Druid, other spell list) is more difficult.
        o A spell that's higher level then you can cast is more difficult.
        o A completely new effect is even more difficult.
        Such effects cost Arcana the more powerful they are, and with factors that increase difficulty. There are also some special modifiers.
        o Truly destroying something, Be Not, involves a massive spike in cost.
        o Making something real and permanent multiples the cost by ten. So if you can afford ten times the cost of Summon Monster IX, then you can permanently call such a set of helpers into being.
        Groups can pool their efforts to achieve greater effects.
        A Memory Of The Face Of Creation (0CP)
        The power of the Arcane, and the necromantic forces that bolt it to a human soul... the mind was not built to cope with such things. Well, other people's minds might not be. You deal with it fine. In fact, you'll find that you deal with everything fine. Madness just doesn't 'take' when it's you. Your mind refuses to warp, your personality stays stable, and your view of reality matches what you sense and perceive.


-Wizard's Lab (Dresden Files) (300CP)
        More of an add-on than your own separate living space, this can either be built into a Residence you own, or add a trapdoor to your Warehouse and store it underneath. It comes equipped with everything you need for magical experiments short of a stuffed crocodile hanging from the ceiling: A built-in summoning circle, shelf after shelf of weird reagents and knick-knacks, a small library of interesting books about magic and the supernatural, and an actual laboratory for making potions and enchanting objects. It's also been heavily reinforced, so any failures or spills will at worst blacken the floors.


-Workshop Equipment (Bloodborne) (300CP)
        This is actually a package deal containing a variety of workshop tools. The first tool set has some basic tools for repairing equipment and some more specialized tools for upgrading weaponry with varying Blood Stones. The second set of tools allows for the slotting and removal of Blood Gems, items that as previously mentioned can greatly empower weaponry. The last set of tools allows you to etch Caryll Runes into the mind to attain their wondrous strength, or remove them just as easily. Runesmith Caryll, student of Byrgenwerth, transcribed the inhuman utterings of the Great Ones into what are now called Caryll Runes. Etching these runes into your mind can provide a number of benefits. Benefits can range from resisting certain types of damage, increasing resistance to various poisons or increasing stamina and vitality, among other effects. You may etch up to three runes into your mind at a time. These runes can be found scattered around this world.
        * Enhance weapons by slotting in blood gems
        * Transcribe eldritch god utterings into your mind for powers


-Altar of Spellmaking (Morroblivion) (400CP)
        Your own personal altar of spellmaking. Allows you to make spells. With Spellmaker increases efficiency of the process and quality of spells made.


-Arcanatarium (Twokinds) (400CP)
        A trained mage can throw out spells on the fly, but the really impressive magic is prepared far in advance. For that, you'll need a place to work. This workshop is fully outfitted to support a practiced mage in all their pursuits. There's a permanent magic circle to focus your energies, a table of alchemical equipment for the brewing of potions, a well-stocked library full of tomes and scrolls of arcane knowledge, and any other dedicated workspace you'll need for working magic. This workshop also comes stocked with plenty of ingredients and materials for your alchemicy and artifact crafting, including rarer materials like precious metals and gems. You'll still need to provide any extremely rare or unique items, but this personalized workspace will have anything else you need for your own arcane pursuits. This property can take any form you wish, from a traditional tower to a basement laboratory. Post-jump, this workshop can be imported and attached to any property you own


-Bleak Atelier of Necro-Engineers (Exalted - The Abyssals) (400CP)
        Faith, magic and technology come together in the factory-cathedral. Within its walls were produced glorious wonders reserved for the greatest gods and Chosen. Almost none of these wondrous factory-cathedrals endure today, and those that remain are terribly damaged or lost to the impassable wilderness. But while practically no one alive could build a factory-cathedral today, the Deathlords are some of the few beings that could. Still, only one amongst the deathlords is officially known to possess an equivalent...
        And now, you may acquire one of these wonders of dark design. Built as a great tower, this imposing manse has been designed to serve both as a factory-cathedral reminiscent of those built in the First Age and as an equally effective necrosurgery laboratory using more recent designs pioneered by the Deathlords. Unlike the hallowed cathedrals built by the Solars of old, these halls have not been sanctified or constructed as a temple-manse. Instead, special precautions have been taken to ensure the cold, sterile perfection of the Abyssal Essence that powers the horrible machines within.
        Within these workshops, long forgotten First Age tools are set side by side with just as sophisticated new innovations. Here, eldritch suspension vats preserve the dead. Essence-fueled welding tools fuse bone to bone. Flasks of reagents bubble and strange devices whir, spark and glow. The place carries about it a dark majesty that scares away most natural animals and invites bad weather, yet the environment stays oddly dry and cool. Black ornaments inset with iron, onyx, and obsidian further channel the manse's Essence into necromantic power, such that the costs of necromantic spells cast within the manse's walls are significantly reduced. Furthermore, the manse bolsters the strength of such spells beyond the capabilities of the necromancer's own Essence. All the better to animated the necrotic warmachines one might create within.


-Gromwood (Skulduggery Pleasant V1.05) (400CP)
        This house on a hill, large enough to be considered a manor, has come into your possession, perhaps after the death of a relative. While it has many rather ominous pictures on its walls and no small amount of unused sports equipment, the houses true appeal is what lies underneath it. Thought a secret passageway, you may access an extensive labyrinth hidden below the property. This labyrinth, called the Caves of the Void, is home to a variety of monsters capable of smelling magic, which they use to hunt intruders. You of course, won't be hunted by these beasts (unless you want to be, for whatever reason). Within this maze are veins of a special black crystal, which has been a key component used to create weapons like the Sceptre of the Ancients, capable of killing gods. And in the deepest part of the caves is the Source Fountain, a pool that turns whatever you place within it magical. The house is completely paid off, and has free running water, electricity, AC and secure internet.




-Miskatonic University (Smash Up-Obligatory Cthulhu Supplement) (400CP)
        Home of the Fighting Cephalopods, this college campus has an unusually soothing atmosphere, a well-stocked library, and most curiously, everyone studying here benefits from any memory, training/learning booster or uncapper perks you personally possess.


-Prismatic Laboratory (Fallen London) (400CP)
        The principle of acute observation is light! And to that end, you have fashioned a workspace of lenses, liquids, critters and crystals to focus upon recreating a spectrum of lights fantastic. Ah, the impossible palette: those colors only seen in the Neath! You may not always produce something like it, but you will produce their inks and lenses in time.


-Progressive Estate (Fate/Legends - Strange New World) (400CP)
        No man of science is complete without his laboratory of choice and neither can a proper magus be found without a workshop to house his life's work. It's much more rare that both are found in the same place however. This rather luxurious, lush and expansive estate you now own, with a few hundred acres of land and very sizeable manor house, is really just the window dressing. Attached to that fancy house up there is a combined laboratory/mansion the size of the very mansion it is attached to. Filled with technology and academic research at the very cutting edge of the 20th century, and somehow a few steps further in some cases, on three different fields of technology as well as a wide range of magecraft tools, research and notes on three magical topics of choice that would be well regarded even in the upper echelons of the Mages' Association. While each side is already quite impressive, it is the small library regarding the efforts of the previous owner of the home to find applications towards mixing each side that is the hidden gold here. Notes on how to truly bring out the potential of technology with magecraft and vice versa are here. As well as all this, the entire estate, manor and laboratory are surrounded with multiple layers of defense and obfuscation of both technological and magical means. A small army could not break in, even if they could find the place. You may import a property into this.


-Suzunaan (Touhou Forbidden Hermit) (400CP)
You have a kasha-hon, a kind of traditional Japanese library, containing a wide variety of mostly-mundane books. On its own it will turn a mild profit, sufficient to live off and have minor hobbies on your own, but in addition it contains the materials for a traditional Japanese woodblock printing press. Books, scrolls and the like copied with the press will retain all the supernatural abilities of the original copy, enabling you to mass-produce enchanted papercrafts, though depending on the size of the book you are unlikely to be able to produce more than a few hundred every day of work, and producing the woodblocks to print will take some time on its own.


-Temple of Solomon (Fate/Legends - Oasis of Fantasy) (400CP)
        A place that has long been abandoned or, at least, a replica of the one currently in use. The Temple of Solomon is perhaps the grandest magical workshop ever to be created, one so great that it does not even exist in the mundane world. Sealed away in imaginary number space, it is only accessible to others through highly complex and difficult magical workings, though you can enter your hidden base with nothing but a thought provided you are not blocked by some means. The temple itself is quite large, with the small dimension covering several city blocks of area and the building being the size of a large mansion. Within is almost every one of Solomon's personal notes and research on magecraft and magic, along with a great deal of lore from other famous magicians of his time and from later on as well. The small dimension has been connected to a replica of Solomon's created magical circuits which empower the framework the workshop sits on, serving to provide a immense magical fuel source for any project you might wish to run within this space as you can freely draw on the amount of energy the King of Magic had while alive when you are in here. Finally, death in this realm is not permanent and it is far easier to bring back those who die when it is within this place. For your purposes, this means that dying in this temple will not count as an end to your chain. You may import an existing structure into this role.
        * Solomon made the entire modern magic framework that allows for magecraft in fate


-The Alchemy Machine (Shivers) (400CP)
        Created by the legendary alchemist Louis Garcon, this mysterious machine combines modern science with principles passed down from ancient Egyptian times. Should you have any alchemic ability or knowledge, using this machine will not only drastically enhance the potency of anything you create, but also significantly boost the output. Careful experimentation may even let you learn to automate the alchemic process, allowing the machine to produce indefinitely if provided with supplies. Without such knowledge, though, expect significantly more experimentation before you achieve anything of note.


-The Artful Temple That Is Not (Exalted - The Infernals) (400CP)
        Unlike the many other Yozis, Oramus has no temples in the Demon City beyond the great prison-temple built atop his slumbering form. Thus, this temple cannot exist despite its meticulously artful design and wondrously magnificence the likes of which seem impossible to ever match in other architecture.
        And in truth, this is correct. For this temple exists Beyond, the place of things which are cast out and never existed at all. All around it are floating worldscapes; upside-down places, angled places, in-and-out places. Existence seems to have the quality of a cube winding in toward a central locus, and all through the air floated things unguessed and never before seen.
        Here, in these alien vistas beyond perception, which are an infinite forge of the impossible that stirred the very Wyld into forms and patterns by the movement of your thoughts, you may create and think on those things deemed impossible by all. Still, caution is for the wise, for while you are protected by reality within the walls of this temple, the outside is not so kind and should you get lost behind babbling brooks of names... you might find that you never really existed at all.
        Of course, bringing this manse within Creation or Hell would defeat the very point of its construction. And so alternative measure have been devised. With but a sideways step through any doorway, the holder of the temple's hearthstone may step within its walls, and from inside you may also open a stable portal to other realms so that others might likewise enter.


-The Hall of the Perfect Circle (Exalted - The Solars) (400CP)
        The Solar Exaltation is an engine of near perfection, split up into five parts. The castes serve to diversify the bearers of the exaltation and is brought into harmony within a perfect circle, a gathering of a single member of each of the five castes. And in honor of this most sacred harmony, this manse has been constructed. A great manor built in the style of the early first age, where perfect geometry and design met with principles of practicality and efficiency; a far cry from the ostentatious grandeur of the later years.
        But within the main hall rests five doors in perfect symmetry, each bearing the mark of a different caste emblazoned upon their face. Behind each door lies a room constructed to push the abilities of the Lawgivers to their very limits, to awaken further understanding through adversity.
        For the Bronze Tigers an ever shifting battlefield, complete with highly skilled automatons and simulated environments to push even the most skilled warriors to their very limits.
        For the Golden Bulls therein lies a temple to the Highest of Holies, a place where they can focus and realign themselves to their cause. As an additional provision this temple also contains tools and features to help train resistance, such as meditations on a bed of spikes or walking across molten orichalcum.
        For the Copper Spiders, a most wondrous forge to be theirs. Complete with all the tools required to construct some truly awe inspiring works of artifice should they possess the talent and the patience.
        For the Iron Wolves, their room contains an ever shifting puzzle building. Fixed only when the door is opened this place is designed to push stealth and infiltration techniques to the highest possible level. However one other benefit is the owner can submit the plans to a compound, real or not, and find it simulated here as a way to test their skills through places of their own devising.
        And finally for the Quicksilver Falcons, within their portal lies the ballroom of a magnificent manor. Within here simulacrums vie and jockey for social standing, ever perceptive to the slightest misstep and always eager for the slightest loophole in an agreement. After learning to survive and thrive in this merciless atmosphere, navigating most other social events is almost no effort at all.


-The Sixfold Weave of Sublime Efficacy (Exalted - The Infernals) (400CP)
        Quite unlike the other manses on offer here, this is not actually a singular manse. Instead, it is a network of six smaller manses arranged in an artful pattern of geomantic resonance, empowering the central manse with the essence gleaned of the other five. Each created from white brass and inlaid with black basalt, the five are formed into slender towers that channel their essence towards the center, while on their own providing little more than a luxurious abode and a minor hearthstone.
        It is the central manse that is of most note to you, though it is still build up a weaker demesne than the other manses you might acquire here, the difference is more than made up for by the creative power funneled into it by the supporting manses. A palace of white brass walls and ringed by streets of black basalt, it is a marvel to the eye built to be just as aesthetically pleasing as it is functional. Her walls are decorated with frescoes bearing differing images of the Mother of Creation and the demon princes descended from her, fortified to withstand the greatest of sieges. Her halls are lit with purest white flames that burn eternally, miniscule fragments taken from the flame that would become the Daystar's solar flames. Her rooms are furnished with wealth to bankrupt many princes, every need and want you might have catered to by the servile intelligence of the manse itself, her only desire to aid you. Even the essence of the manse adapts to make sure you are comfortable and every small detail aligns in your favor.
        And beyond all that, you will find many, many rooms filled with magnificent workshops for every craft imaginable. Glassworking, pottery, smithing, painting, woodworking, jewelcrafting, and many more. The manse itself will aid you with any project you wish to take on within these halls, tools responding to your desires as eagerly as to your touch, and even gentle advice given on any of your handiwork if you wish for another opinion. Should you desire to, you may rearrange the flow of essence from the supporting manses to another manse than this one, but in reaction the palace shall become still, unable to help you as it wishes.


-Walls Containing Madness (Dark Souls 2) (400CP)
        This appears as a small castle with architecture of your choosing. The entirety of this structure's rooms and corridors appears dedicated to the pursuit of knowledge.
        Scientific work stations with various tools and instruments appear in most rooms, chains from which to hang cages and other things hang from the ceiling, and the basement contains all manner of chests and cells where the scavenged and unwilling are stored.
        Samples from captured and dissected creatures, among other beings, will be stocked within the basement, and replicated into the future for as many experiments as required. You must of course secure such valuable organs and parts yourself the first time, however.


-Wizard's Domain (Ben 10 0.1) (400CP)
        Having seen the writing on the wall or having been stolen from someone who did, you have managed to isolate a small pocket of Ledgerdomain and constructed a defensible lair within it. This is a comfortable mansion with plenty of amenities, books on simple and advanced spells from this world, and conveniently generates any spell components you happen to need for your many spells and rituals. In addition, being in an isolated dimension made of magic greatly empowers your own spellcasting and makes it both easier to cast and just a bit more powerful. You may enter and leave this little pocket plane simply by thinking about it, a portal entering or leaving it appearing nearby.


-Working Unlimited Guns (Fate/Grand Order - Part One) (400CP)
        A complete gun smithing set made out of a strange black metal. There are tools here for every process of creation, from shaping the metal to the fine details of the gun itself. What makes this set special is several qualities. Firstly, any gun it creates will count as a magical creation and the user is able to copy spells or magic that they can use into the gun to transfer those effects onto the weapon itself, though how they manifest may change depending on the gun type. The forge is also able to easily convert other weapons or objects into guns of similar size, retaining all their normal properties but in firearm form.


-Workshop (Generic Naruto Fanfiction) (400CP)
        Going out and beating people up is not all there is to being a ninja, certainly not in the myriad worlds of Naruto fanfiction. There's a lot of space for less outdoorsy activities, such as seal-creation, weapons-forging, and so on. That's where this beautiful place comes in! It's the ultimate workshop, perfect for just about anything you may care to work at. It has a huge supply of papers and inks for your fuuinjutsu needs, herbs and plants for preparing poisons or medicines, a forge and metal supplies for smithing, timber for woodwork, and so on, for anything else you may care to work on. The quantities of the materials generated depend on their rarity and value. Something like ordinary paper and ink, or plain steel and wood, would never run out no matter how much you use, while things like paper from special, chakra-enriched trees would be in far shorter supply. But no matter how rare something might be, so long as it's not absolutely unique, you can expect to find it here, and in sufficient quantities to work with. At the absolute slowest, for materials of priceless rarity like high quality chakra-storing gemstones or metals, you could expect a supply to regenerate bi-yearly, and proportionately lesser times for less rare substances. In future worlds this workshop updates with materials and ingredients of the respective settings, with the same replenishment rules remaining in effect.


-Dwarven Forge (Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 2) (500CP)
        There is a place called Nidavellir. A place that has contained a dying neutron star, it was known for creating some of the most powerful weapons to exist in all of the Nine Realms. Forges were heated eternally from the heat of this star, strong enough to kill even the greatest of Asgardians were it not for one of the weapons forged in this very place. The mythical Uru springs from this place, metal that is used in the weapons of the gods. Such a place would cause untold prosperity or ruin depending on who held this place. Mayhaps the dwarves who controlled such a place realized the dangers of only having one, so there is a second structure that has been hidden away in the event Nidavellir was attacked. Maybe call it Myrkheim? Regardless, the heart of a dying star is yours to use in these mythical forges. Great works shall be created in these halls. Terrible, but great. Just don't get in the way of the focusing lens. It could kill you.


-Portable Geneforge Components (Geneforge) (500CP)
        This is most of what is needed to build a Geneforge of your own. However it is also very small in comparison to a full geneforge, using this you might be able to create a full geneforge that fits in the back of a wagon. Though it lacks the required information for how to get it to truly shape others, but you could find or produce most of that on your own.


-A Secret World (Touhou Forbidden Hermit) (600CP)
You have an entire small alternate dimension to customise and play around in. By default, it takes on the form of a featureless blank void stretching across an area the size of a small village, though you can reshape it according to your whims, perhaps turning it into a nice house. Additionally, you can create doors leading into it nearly anywhere, as long as it is on the back of something such as someone’s back, the back of a statue, and similar backs.


-At The End of Time (Divinity - Original Sin) (600CP)
        The Sanctuary was once home to the pair of god-blessed humans who were appointed guardians over the box that kept darkness from this world. With no interference, they will soon rediscover it and slowly begin gaining access to the variety of rooms it houses. But due to a wrinkle in time, space, or perhaps simply in response to your own special nature, a copy of that magical space seems to have sprung into existence. Not a perfect copy with bound elementals and a Tapestry of Time, mind, but similar enough to service as a fine base in the space between worlds. The Second Sanctuary can be accessed through a small magical emerald in the shape of a pyramid. Tapping it will teleport you directly to the dining hall. Tapping it once inside will teleport you back to exactly where you were when you came in.
        The Second Sanctuary will be surrounded on all sides by empty space, with stars sprinkling the blackness off in the far distance. This is merely an illusion as the rooms occupy a pocket dimension and are not actually situated in outer space. If you desire, you can set the view to that of appearing to float amidst a certain solar system you have already encountered. It contains two plush bedrooms, each with a queen-sized four-post bed, desk, a chair, several chests, and a wardrobe, everything crafted from wood and comfortable red fabrics. In addition there is a small dining hall set off to one side in the midst of a well-tended garden. The table will feed anyone who sits down at it with simple, but filling, food and drink.
        The Second Sanctuary also comes equipped with a large, but currently empty, library and a workshop that includes a classic forge, tools and all. Don't be surprised to if you find a tall Elf wandering the library or relaxing at the feasting table. He dresses as loudly as a rainbow on several kinds of narcotics and is a little too friendly when it comes to invading personal space, but he's worth listening to. When he does stop by, his pockets, packs, and spaceship (How do you think he got here? Flapping his arms?) will be simply packed to the gills with magical weapons, enchanted armor, mysterious trinkets, and mystic essences brought with him from Rivellon proper. His stock tends to very wildly with each visit, but he'll usually have at least a few eye-catching artifacts. Who know what he might find in his travels through the multiverse? You might be surprised just what he can get his fingers on. Just don't expect him to sell anything for less than it's truly worth. He's too cunning for that. And yes, his name is Jack. How did you guess?


-Caern (World of Darkness - Werewolf the Apocalypse) (600CP)
        A caern is a natural upwelling of spiritual energy. Werewolves and fera treasure and protect them as holy sites and places to renew their spiritual ties and gather for various rituals. Unlike normal caerns that can be exhausted or fade without ritual support, yours will never fade and has a regenerating supply of spiritual energy and magic. You may freely allow or bar people from using the energy the caern provides to refill their gnosis pool. Normally the garou nation would make a rather large stink about a couple of low rank werewolves owning a caern, but the property it sits on is legally yours via inheritance, hook or crook, or outright buying it from some human that didn't know any better. Drop Ins that purchase this find a deed in their warehouse. It comes with ten acres of forest, but you may import another property to get the benefits. For an extra 100 points the forest increases to 100 acres, becomes tax free, and becomes immune to attempts to buy it or steal it via legal shenanigans.


-Cosmic Anvil (DC - All-Star Superman) (600CP)
        A gift from New Olympus delivered straight to your doorstep, Jumper!
        This anvil and hammer are capable of smashing atoms together to form miniature suns, and with a bit of work, even miniature planets. Potentially, you could make them even bigger, or even 'life-sized'...though this will take weeks or even months of work and it's recommended to do so somewhere within space.


-Enchanter's Forge (Nexus 2.0) (600CP)
        A rare thing in Nexus, the Enchanter's Forges are the result of a magical catastrophe well before recorded history, considered myths by most people to this day. An Enchanter's Forge is actually a chaotic collection of magics and Mist in a small pocket dimension that will bind itself to an individual that claims it. The power held within this collection of magics is potent and may be worked as if it were a material substance, though it must be anchored to a physical medium to be of actual use, effectively tying the resulting magics to an object. This creates an enchantment that can potentially carry a wide variety of effects.
        Working the magic within an Enchanter's Forge is exceptionally difficult, requiring a lifetime of work to master the process and gain the potential to create truly powerful enchantments. Until then, you can only really give minor ones such as an enchantment for a blade to drink in blood to repair itself or creating a bow that produces its own arrows. Actually making enchantments with the Enchanter's Forge takes a great deal of time, requiring a heavy investment in time to actually create any powerful enchantments. Even then, you must experiment and practice with it to garner any results, no two Enchanter's Forges are the same, meaning you cannot rely on the experiences of others to guide your own use. The power within an Enchanter's Forge never seems to run out, and it is a great source of magical power if you possess some other way to utilize it


-First Nome (Kane Chronicles) (600CP)
        The First Nome in Egypt is the oldest and most impressive in the entire House of Life. It has the most extensive library, the largest collection of artifacts, the most members, and the most overall resources. It also hosts the Hall of Ages and the (currently empty) throne of the pharaoh. Now you can bring it with you, importing it into each new setting. As a bonus, the Nome's membership will include magicians from past and future worlds you've visited, its library will include books of other magic systems, and its vaults will include artifacts from the same. The Hall of Ages will detail the history of whatever world it is currently in, with side corridors providing less detailed accounts of former worlds.


-Flying Island Facility (In Another World With My Smartphone) (600CP)
        Taking a page out of the book of Regina Babylon you made (or perhaps discovered if you're not a techno-magical genius yourself) your own flying island with its own buildings and facilities built on top of it. The island is heavily magically warded and protected and you don't need to worry about people on the ground noticing it, and there is a teleport pad that can take you down to the surface. You can teleport back, alongside anyone you give permission, to the island from any place in the world you're currently in. Your island comes with its own gynoid that oversees it and makes sure it's operating smoothly. They're quirky but friendly and completely loyal to you. This flying island can mimic any of the ones that Regina Babylon herself made or, for 600 CP total (300 discounted) you can have a completed island with all 9 facilities once again combined together, alongside nine gynoids to look after it. If the facilities or gynoids are destroyed they'll show up a week later good as new. The gynoids aren't companions unless you import them as such later on. Alternatively, there is an option in the Companion section that has them start as companions, which you can read the details of in that section.


-Goblin Forge (Hellboy) (600CP)
        A replica of the forge used by the nameless goblin smith who forged the Golden Army. The forge is magical, and can do much of the work in the forging process by itself, only needing your input for the first designs before becoming capable of churning out an army- or the weapons to equip them- in a much shorter amount of time than would be thought possible. The items forged by it are all but indestructible, and will last for millennia without needing repair or upkeep. It will be up to you to provide any resources needed for their crafting, however, but any enchantments you choose to apply will be applied evenly to every craft you wish it to be, so long as you can supply it in the creation of the first one. Can become a Warehouse attachment Post-Jump.


-Gushimera Laboratory (God Catching Alchemy Meister) (600CP)
        This research facility used to belong to powerful mages before they were overrun by demons. Some of the knowledge was lost as the demons made their home there, but after a while they just went away and this precious fountain of knowledge came into your hands. The facility was geared towards the creation of golems, artificial Mana Spirits and even has notes about creating homunculus. It's still somewhat operational and full of information waiting to be discovered. It will become a warehouse attachment post-jump.


-Khorne's Anvil (Warhammer Fantasy: Warriors of Chaos) (600CP)
        This massive anvil is a one of a kind gift from the Master of Murder, completely engraved with the markings of Khorne. It will seem like it is otherwise unassuming until you begin creating weapons on it. Weapons that are hammered into shape in this anvil will be of masterwork quality regardless of the metals used, and they are eternally sharp and will never wear and tear. But this is not the greatest gift of the anvil. Khorne is willing to use the souls of magic users who are sacrificed on the anvil to grant a weapon a magic effect that reflects the magical strength of the mage that was sacrificed on it...with no limits. This may seem hypocritical for Khorne, but Khorne believes that magic weapons made from a subjugated mage is perhaps the greatest example of might over magic, and the weapon's existence confirms his ideals.


-Lab Space (Asterix the Gaul) (600CP)
        Be a Roman engineer or a Gaulish druid, both need a space that's completely theirs, so that they can work in peace. This is the one for you. Filled with the absolute latest in instruments and tools, and with a truly staggering variety of parts and materials, it's basically the perfect workshop. You even find your mind working sharper here, allowing you to innovate at a slightly increased speed than normal. In every following jump, this updates with the absolute cutting edge of all the tools, materials and substances required for the pursuit of both science and magic, enough for you to come up with true wonders no matter where you end up. Again, this doesn't stock one of a kind materials that you would normally require a month long quest to get. Rather, if it's available in a shop anywhere in the world, a mortal shop, you will find it here


-Magic Research Facility (The Death Mage Who Doesn't Want A Fourth Time) (600CP)
        Magic and science. Alone they are great, together and in the right hands they are all powerful. The sleekness of a laboratory at the cutting edge of science, housing the greatest tools, magical and otherwise. A great thing that has come into your possession. Either inserted somewhere in the world itself, lodged away in your warehouse, or attached to some property you already having following you around, is a high-tech facility on par with, or perhaps slightly above, that which the eponymous Vandalieu had been trapped and tortured within during his time in Origin. Its tools are specially made to analyze and interact with magic, and as such it is the perfect home for magical experiments of all kinds. Whether it be dissecting or containing monsters, trying out brand new spells, or even processing and mass producing magical materials and even magic items, this facility is perfectly made for all of it. Of possibly greatest use to those with great stores of magic is the spell testing room, however, as this room is perfectly suited for testing out and analyzing even the most powerful of spells, localizing its effects and preventing even the most powerful of them from affecting anything outside of them.


-Rogue Nome (Kane Chronicles) (600CP)
        Apparently you weren't alone when you broke with the House of Life. You brought two or so a dozen friends with you, all nearly as skilled in Egyptian magic as you are. You collectively occupy a mansion that is either magically hidden from mortals or situated in the Duat - the difference can be negligible at times. It is defended by powerful spells, well supplied in terms of both mundane and magical resources, and has a library filled with scrolls and books on magic and the gods. The magicians here do not count as companions, and the Nome can either be imported into later settings or made into a warehouse attachment.


-Star Forge (Marvel Magic) (600CP)
        Great Mjolnir, the hammer of Thor, was forged using the heart of a dying star, cut from the place it hanged in space by Allfather Odin himself and placed within an enchanted forge. This forge and the mold for Mjolnir was stolen and used by Loki to make a legion of brother hammers to Mjolnir during the final Ragnarok. This mould and the lesser hammers were - or perhaps will be - destroyed by Thor and channeled into an attack. But now you have come into possession of something similar. This forge, which takes the form of a special room connected to your warehouse, contains within it the heart of a dying star. This is, of course, a powerful tool, but most beings would be unable to use it directly without suffering near instant death. You are not most beings and I have the utmost confidence that you will think of something.


-The Dragons Cradle (Exalted - The Dragonbloods) (600CP)
        In areas where there are powerful intersections of the essence of creation, places of magical potency can be found. The concentration of essence twists and warps the surrounding area into a Demense. However cunning architects and sorcerers can tap into this power, and construct structures on these ley lines to harness the power towards their own ends. These structures are known as Manses, and they are valuable resources to those that hold them. Thanks to the approval of your benefactor, we have been authorized to construct a place of power which can be attached to your warehouse, whatever that is.
        This manse will take the form of a luscious two story manor, with the in depth specifications up to you, with its elemental affinity matching yours. However what we can guarantee is a fully stocked library where you will likely find all manner of useful tomes, one of the most advanced workshops we can create to ensure you have somewhere to ply your crafts, a full set of bound servants to maintain the property, and a considerable allotment space. From the inherent power present in the manse you will find it much easier to grasp the secrets of essence, as it is a font of gaian magics; as well as any children you may have here bearing the dragon's blood will find it far more likely to exalt in the future, thanks to the potent elemental essence empowering all of its residents.
        Oh and one final feature we should add, is that it also generates a Hearthstone. This jewel, roughly the size of a chicken's egg, can either aid in your ability to recover essence through proximity or be used to power any magitech you may possess. Should you take it into the world and plant it in the ground, within one hour your manse will sprout from the ground fully formed. Although while you can retrieve the hearthstone afterwards be aware this can only be done once every ten years.


-The Underhaus (Exalted - The Abyssals) (600CP)
        Your very own Underworld. Or at least, a slice of Underworld for yourself. For 200 cp, this adds an Underworld layer to your cosmic warehouse, taking on the appearance of a dark reflection of your existing warehouse, seen through the lens of death. Located "below" your warehouse in the same way that the greater Underworld is below the living world of Creation, you may designate parts of your warehouse to be small, enduring shadowlands to access this Underhaus more easily. Here you may respire necrotic essence, interact with ghosts and immaterial spirits, and store things that cannot bear the light of the sun.
        Alternatively, if that isn't enough, you may pay a full 600 cp and get something much more expansive. Instead of merely receiving a dark mirror of your warehouse, each of the various attachments, properties, and lands that follow you will have underworld reflections of their own. These properties shall sit as anchors within the world and each of your properties, in whole or in part, may be made into shadowlands to lead down into this greater Underhaus. Connecting all of these disjointed underworld landmarks will be an underworld appropriate to the world they stand in, a dark world that gains solidity and detail from the memories of the dead. Where none have lived or died, the terrain is grey and nearly featureless phantasms. But where many people have lived their lives and breathed their last, this underworld is filled with dark reflections and remnants of what has been lost. Primeval forests that have since been cut down and burnt for farmland, the remnants of cities lost to war and villages lost to plague, and whatever else has been lost to the sands of time in the world you find yourself in. The population of this underworld, aside from any followers you bring with you, would be composed merely of plasmic creatures and echoes of the dead, not true ghosts of the natives. However, once established below a world, the dead of that place may choose to resist the call of whatever fate would normally remain for them past death, to linger within the Underhaus as ghosts.
        * Gives all the workshops and lands a underworld layer to craft with plus some other stuff


-Wizard's Tower (Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon) (600CP)
        Avalon is the land of the fairies, an almost unreachable realm that has only seen a handful of human, partially or fully, visitors in all of time. Within Avalon, there can be found smaller realms, such as the one that Merlin will eventually come to be imprisoned within. The realm you find yourself with access to is similar to that realm but does not imprison you. This place, a small dimension measuring a few miles across, is filled with a field of gorgeous flowers. In the centre of the dimension is a tall wizard's tower. There are many rooms, workshops and laboratories within this tower, filled with extremely rare materials, resources, reagents and magical curios, as well as a fair few creature comforts and luxuries. Many of these resources will replenish in time too. There are even a great deal of books written on various magical subjects, some by Merlin himself and some by those much older than even him. You may enter this realm with just a thought, through all but the most powerful and thorough of preventions against dimensional travel, and exit out into any location without those most powerful protections. While others can potentially invade your dimension should they find out about it, the tower realm has protections against invasion on a similar level to the sheath Avalon does when activated.


-World Hacking (A Super Mario Thing) (600CP)
Toads are the primary builders in the Mario universe – more than you would think.  In fact, they help to create new worlds and levels by tampering with the reality and moving land segments and other things about; they don’t always get things right, which explains why everything is so wacky.  With this perk, you can safely use various methods, whether through your own powers or mechanical lifting, to safely remove chunks of land and transport them to new locations.  The inserted pieces will fit into the new level without the shattering, earthquakes, and other effects that normal people are used to.  Furthermore, the various chunks can touch each other without damaging each other, such that you can even transplant icebergs onto lava fields or vice versa without problems ensuing.  On the other hand, you’ll have to practice to figure out how to get the different pieces to align with each other, or else you’ll get a jumbled mess of a level.  Still, with enough work you can create your own unique, Super Mario Bros.-style levels and worlds for people to explore.




--- Domain: Supplies: Mundane Small Scale (9) (32 Perks) --- 




-Electronics (Star Wars - KOTOR) (50CP)
        A large supply of computer spikes and repair parts that can be used with nearly any modern machine in the galaxy. Computer spikes overwhelm electronics with junk data and are used by hackers to aid them in bypassing electronic security doors and terminals. Repair parts are packages of universally adaptable components that can be used to fix or upgrade droids, vehicles, and other machines.


-The Gourmet Case (Toriko) (50CP)
Keeps ingredients warm or cold naturally. It is a vacuum package container that can contain the data from 10,000 kinds of different ingredients. If the selected ingredient is not in its memory, it has to be manually set up based on its environment that it was found in. One can expand the memory with a memory card. The price for the Takeout 1000 with a memory for 1000 Ingredients is ¥90,000 yen. (Memory card sold separately. Just joking. You get memory cards for each ingredient found in the Human World.)


-Inexhaustible QE Comm Link (Eclipse Phase) (100CP)
        Two fingernail-sized Quantum Entanglement communication arrays. If each is installed in a separate device, those two devices can communicate instantaneously no matter the distance. Unlike standard QE comms in the setting, the qubits are not expended when information is transmitted. It has the bandwidth of a high-speed fibre optic connection.


-Material Limitations (World Seed) (100CP)
        Even with the advanced technology commonplace on Earth nowadays, material limitations haven't changed. Or rather, you could say that they've gotten even worse. After all, how are you going to store antimatter if you have only steel at hand? Luckily, you won't ever have problems finding the materials you need. Whether you'll stumble upon them while searching through a scrapyard, or find just the right people who can get you that obscure alloy you need, nothing will stop you from building whatever you want besides your own skill. Well, if you're keeping it reasonable, at least.
        The chance of you finding what you're searching for decreases exponentially with the material's strength and rarity, and increases by how much you know about said material, scientifically, and how good your technology skills are. So while a regular schmuck would probably never find Adamantium, someone who could reproduce it themselves in only a few years would have much, much better chances. So if you're in a situation where it is impossible to get what you want with what you know and where you are right now? Then you'll have to get to work yourself. Good riddance then that you can eventually reproduce any material or alloy that you have seen, though for extremely advanced ones it might take an unreasonable amount of time and skill.


-Memory Crystal (Five Star Stories) (100CP)
        A backup memory crystal, strong enough that it could easily be used to instantly record live combat information to be replayed later. It could also be used for other mundane purposes, such as serving as the hard drive for multiple supercomputers.


-Nanomaterials Sieve (Arpeggio of Blue Steel) (100CP)
        This sand sieve can be used to filter nanomaterials from seawater and sand. Even in settings where the seawater doesn't have any nanomaterial particles from damaged Fog ships, it somehow produces about a pound of nanomaterials each time its scooped through the ocean and sand.


-Nullspace Computer (Megas XLR) (100CP)
        You have a computer tower you can summon from and banish to nullspace. allowing you to upgrade it but otherwise keep it safe. You may summon a holographic interface for it at will.
        * Massive upgradable supercomputer that can be kept safe by existing outside reality and simultaneously be used due to its holographic interface making it an extremely useful item which benefits from all abilities which improve its performance while being entirely tamper proof.


-Originite Prime Bundle (Arknights) (100CP)
        You gain access to several crates of pure Originium that can be utilized for various means, and will restock itself every week. Wrong handling will be dangerous, however post-Jump, this will be perfectly safe to use in any way.        * A common mineral in Terra, this semi-transparent black crystal contains enormous energy, and is the primary factor of causing Catastrophes. Widely used in the field of Arts, it works as the basic material and catalyst of all kinds of Arts and Arts items. Without Originium, the efficiency of Arts would, without a doubt, drop dramatically. As technologies develop, more and more countries start to use it as an energy source.


-Thanatonium Supply (Arpeggio of Blue Steel) (100CP)
        A material used in corrosive torpedos and other Fog weaponry, this highly unstable matter is used along with nanomaterials to create some of the exotic effects that the Fog's technology is known for, such as graviton engines, and the various gravity and space-altering superweapons. This is a small stockpile, enough to fully re-arm a Fog vessel with corrosive torpedos. The stockpile replenishes monthly in your warehouse.


-Common Material Cache | Rare Material Cache | Lightsaber Crystals (Star Wars The Old Republic) (150CP)
        Common Material Cache x2 (50CP)
        This cache contains common 'mundane' crafting materials, such as durasteel, synthweave, armorplast, and tibana gas. Each cache contains sufficient material to fully outfit 4 people, with enough left over to keep the gear repaired between refills. Includes blueprints for turning your materials into these common materials, plus blueprints for all other items you purchase with CP. The material is replaced yearly.
        Rare Material Cache (50CP)
        It's unlikely to be useful anywhere else, but just in case, this cache contains 10 kilograms each of several Lightsaber-resistant materials: beskar, phrik, ultrachrome, and refined cortosis. The metals are ready for use in crafting or modifying equipment. The cache also includes a modest quantity of other exotic materials, such as precious gemstones, technologically useful non-Force-imbued crystals, and organic materials like krayt dragon hide. The material is replaced yearly.
        Lightsaber Crystals (50CP)
        If you want to create more Lightsabers without access to the setting's unique metaphysical geology, you'll need these. Each fist-sized rock has a sample of Force-sensitive crystal growing from its surface, which can easily be broken off into chunks sized for lightsaber crafting or creating Force Focuses. Purchase includes a rock for every type and color of crystal available in the setting, including synthetic crystals such as the red Force-crystals favored by the Sith. The crystals are always properly attuned to whoever harvests them, regardless of color, and will regrow within a day.


-Ecto-Ranium (Danny Phantom 1.5) (200CP)
        Ecto-ranium, the rare and mythical ore that is basically the kryptonite to ghosts. They can not touch it and start to lose their powers when near it. It can be turned into weapons or items. You get a ten pound supply that regenerates monthly. In future jumps this ore will work on incorporeal spirits as if they were solid beings. So you can line your house to keep ghosts out.
-GT Robo (Toriko) (200CP)
The Gourmet Telexistence Robot is a type of robot intended to be used to investigate areas that are normally inaccessible to normal humans. It can supply gourmet ingredients without the user having to step into dangerous soil. The operator can control the movements of the robot from far away and the robot transmits back the senses of sight, touch, hearing, smell and sometimes taste. It can perform the exact same movements in real time. The level of measurement error of the newest GT Robo used by the Bishokukai is less than a millisecond, though individuals with incredible speed like Starjun say that it is still too slow. You can choose from several models of the GT Robo design. The New Model is the first kind of GT Robo seen and also the one mainly used by the Bishokukai. The other kinds of robots seen also seem to be based on this one; the most difficult to control are the Giant type and Micro type. The original models of GT Robos are not used by the Bishokukai and are designed with a more humanoid appearance, with some resembling humanoid robots while others are perfect replicas of the humans they are used by. Original models are used mainly by civilians, wealthy individuals and the Allied Forces. The New Model's body is made of a titanium alloy with carbon fiber. The joints are made of Super High Polymer Special Polyethylene with reinforced aramid fiber body hair covering it. The movements of the robot are relayed by its Core Antenna, made of gold for optimal conductivity.


-Jabberwock Claw (Project Arms) (200CP)
        This remnant of one of the past rampages of the Jabberwock is a uniquely dangerous item, especially to ARMs. One of the few weapons that can equalise a fight between an ARMs and a non- ARMs, this weapon, which can take the appearance of a literal, almost triangular claw or a sword hilt capable of making a blade of glowing nanomachines at your discretion, retains the Jabberwocks healing retarding function, the Anti-ARMs virus that can leave permanent injuries on an ARMs, those normally immortal and perfectly healing superhumans. Like any sword, its lethality depends on how well it's wielded, but it is the swords property that will make sure any wounds caused will refuse to heal properly. This quality will expand to prevent proper healing in anything with abnormal healing and can deal lethal damage to being normally immortal due to fast-healing or outright regeneration.


-Mods & Augments (Mass Effect Andromeda) (200CP)
        Sometimes you just need to coax a bit more performance out of your tools. And sometimes, you just need them to do something else entirely. You now have both a full collection of weapon mods and augmentations, as well as the blueprints to produce more. The mods are usable on any weapon of the matching category, even in future settings. And the augmentations are fantastic when you want to change how a gun performs. Maybe you want an assault rifle that can never run out of ammo, or a shotgun that spits lightning bolts? Or maybe you simply want to change the firing options you have available? If you can break down and build a piece of gear, you can integrate an augmentation into it. And the better skilled you are at building that item, the more augments you can put into it. Keep in mind that some augments have different effects if they are on a weapon versus a piece of armor.


-Nth Metal Ingots (Injustice) (200CP)
        Now this is valuable indeed some of the most valuable material on earth, in fact. This set of ingots, when cast into a proper form and utilized in machinery, can negate gravity, allowing for its user to fly if worn as a belt. Furthermore, it possesses extreme strength and power, making it highly suitable for use in weaponry or armor. You gain about ~1 ton of the material, which replenishes weekly if lost or destroyed (and under no other circumstances).
        * Nth metal has a bunch of other crazy properties like magic negation, cronopowers etc, full list can be found here.


-Ore Chest (God Catching Alchemy Meister) (200CP)
        A magical chest full of different ores, rare metals and even some gems, around a kilogram of each, for a total of 20 kilograms at maximum produced. It replenishes the contents each day at midnight. Making it a stable, if small, source of income. You can put another kilogram of any ore, metal or the likes in there so the chest will also produce it in the future. This could be handy if you ever want an exotic weapon.


-Screaming Rock (Project Arms) (200CP)
        This unnerving rock, strangely and seemingly naturally sculpted to depict numerous hands and faces of the souls who originally found it, is an alien space rock. No, I'm not joking. Whatever native intelligence it has is either in deep sleep, is silently observing content to remaining passive or has long since vacated the substrate of the rock to somewhere else somehow. Either way you are now left you a hunk of nanomachines that are ridiculously versatile in how they be used. With research you can use this to make your own ARMs, and through using cultured samples you can effective have no real limit as to how many you make, but more easily you can use electrodes to connect more conventional computers to this mass as an interface and use it as a super-advanced supercomputer that requires some jury-rigging into making it useful and will probably require a dedicated custom OS (Operating System). It can't be that hard, heck a 12-year-old managed it.


-Spare Parts (Generic Factory) (200CP)
        You will get a large crate marked Spares that will spawn replacement parts whenever something you own or are responsible for maintaining needs replacement parts. The spares will always be of the same quality as the originals. If the crate is destroyed or stolen, it will re-appear whole in your cosmic warehouse the next day.


-Taydenite (Ben 10) (200CP)
        You have found yourself in possession of a large taydenite crystal. Both the rarest and hardest gem in the galaxy, it could be sold for a small fortune. The only thing known to be able to cut taydenite is taydenite. Taydenite is also used to power spaceships, so with some work you could use it as a power source.


-The Green Box (World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression) (200CP)
        A verdant steamer trunk closed with a simple lock, that can only be opened with a key you'll find on your person, always. Filled with an assortment of random bits and doodads that would be considered rare crafting materials for your Aesthetic as well as dozens of other things that could be used to craft Wonders of other Aesthetics, in general it has a massive amount of parts that range from small computer chips to diesel truck engine parts. If you need more just close the box and open it again, it'll be full.


-Olaminium Stock (Trinity:Aeon) (300CP)
        A stable isotope of element 114, this recently created material has replaced depleted uranium as the military's ultra-dense material of choice. Being still light enough that it can be used for construction or armor plating, Olaminium is even better than lead at blocking radiation. The sheer demand for this material makes it extremely expensive to acquire, even for the Aeon Trinity, and it is the preferred material for cutting-edge military-grade equipment. You receive about a shoebox's worth of ingots, which replenishes monthly, and the instructions on how to make more.


-Programmable Metal (Batman the Animated Series) (300CP)
        A special metal that can be programmed with only a few slight touches, creating impressive geometric shapes, weapons, or nigh-unbreakable bindings and changing flexibility and rigidity in a moment's notice. In addition to a small supply of the metal that you have, you also have the know how to make more.


-Done Dirt Cheap (Pokemon Sword and Shield) (400CP)
        What's a researcher to do? Good assistants and proper materials are so hard to come by these days. Well, no, not really, you might just be lazy. You can probably find them off the side of the road if you spent about five minutes. This perk helps you get quick volunteers to help look for things your research depends on; and with getting the basic materials and tools needed to do it in the first place, all on the cheap! You could pay off your helpers with stories, or even the results of your research if you don't care to hang onto it. Also helps with getting help with various other situations with similar benefits.


-Echoes of the Time War (Ben 10 0.1) (400CP)
        Where did you get these? Or when did you get them? This is a trio of Time Beast eggs. They are a substantial power source for time machines, able to charge them up with enough power to go as far as the creation of the universe, someplace most time travelers couldn't hope to reach on their own. Should you instead decide to hatch them, the Time Beasts that emerge will be loyal to you and see you as their parent, being a ferocious pack that can travel up and down the timestream freely. Let's see how smug your enemies are when you send these angry dogs after them years in the past!


-Pale Ore (Hollow Knight Voidheart) (400CP)
        A highly sought after material, filled with pale energy. Pale Ore was often used in the creation of mastercrafted armor and weaponry, for the edges it can produce are ever keen and never require sharpening or maintenance, and their durability is said to outstrip that of many rare alloy metals. In addition, their cold bite can often quickly inflict frostbite on unprotected foes. You've managed to arrange shipments of this ore, granting you several chunks of it every week, more than enough to make a handful of weapons of a suit of armor.


-Saturn Spray (Modded Fallout) (400CP)
        Based on the futuristic space-program alloy 'Saturnite', this spray can contains a liquid compound that rapidly hardens into a transparent, protective yet flexible film that bonds onto whatever item it is used on. As in, it turns the item it's used on effectively invulnerable to any damaging or corroding influence, from bullets to plasma and even radiation and rusting. You could spray a Light Machine Gun, and the barrel and firing chamber would never warp or distort from overheating, for example, nor would the paint job flake off or burn up despite the fact the barrel glows red-hot from continued use. Whatever it's used on simply will not degrade or wear out so long as the spray remains in place. Its flexibility means it doesn't actually provide any increase in protection (you'll still suffer internal trauma even if your armor bounces back right after, for example), but you'll never have to worry about your equipment no longer looking the way it should - or working at less than its original effectiveness, for that matter. Should you want to make some modifications (like changing the paint job to something different), you'll also receive a spray can with the releasing agent, which will cause the Saturn Spray to harmlessly peel off and degrade into everyday chemical waste. Both cans are effectively 'bottomless' and will never run out.


-NZT-48 (Limitless) (500CP)
        You have some pills of NZT-48. This amazing pill lets you easily master many abilities related to the brain, including perfect recall, increased learning speed (fast enough to master the piano in three days), peak human charisma, peak human dexterity and reflexes, hypercompetence, superhuman instincts, peak human sensory absorption, instant analysis, and nigh-unshakable confidence. Unfortunately, the things you learn while using NZT are typically not fully available to you once it wears off.
        For free, you receive a replenishing supply, and the formula for, a version that has a few minor, minor side effects during withdrawal or even with continued usage: memory loss, extreme paranoia, blurred vision, hearing difficulties, psychosis, missing time, skin lesions, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and Limp Dick Syndrome. So yeah, there is a trade-off for genius in a pill.
        For 200 CP (included in above cost), you can get a replenishing supply of, and the formula for, an injectable substance based on a cyclical enzyme system, partially developed by Piper Baird, that temporarily makes one immune to the side effects in case you want to control the distribution of NZT. You also have access to a version that grants permanent immunity. If you do not purchase this option, the in-jump version of this cyclical enzyme system will not work in future jumps. The enzymes are free if you have the capstone booster and Master Chemist.
        For 300 CP (included in above cost), you have a replenishing supply of, and the formula for, a version of NZT-48 that has no side effects. If you do not purchase this option, you will be unable to upgrade the base version to remove the side effects. This version is free for those who purchase the capstone booster.
        For each of these formulas, you may choose to have them work for others or not in future worlds, enabling mass production. However, if they work, others will be able to reverse engineer them so pick your poison. If you choose for them not to work for others, you'll have to oversee the production personally, but the compounds will be immune to analysis.


-Orgel of Origins (Ar Tonelico) (500CP)
        A copy of the original Song Science device. A handheld music box that plays a very carefully calibrated song. It is made of Parameno and Grathnode - and gets hot pretty quickly. Enjoy your white hole generator - this is what powers the entire tower, including the antigravity generators, weather control, and giant beam cannons. All of it. It's an infinite energy generator, with a very high output. Unless you buy both this and Song Science, replicating it is nearly impossible, with both it is tricky.


-Computronium (Eclipse Phase) (600CP)
        One cubic foot of grade-A, pure TITAN-manufactured computronium originally a block of water ice from Iapetus. This is the kind of thing those commie Argonauts would sell their forks into indenture to get one good look at. Whorls of glassy circuitry and fleeting aurora-like flashes of light are trapped within the clear block. Only a high-bandwidth data port betrays its actual purpose. There's more processing power in this one-foot cube than almost any single computer system in the entire solar system (with the possible exception of the rest of the Iapetus matrioshka computer and any other computronium the TITANs have made, of course); it is capable of insanely massive processing feats. It must be kept cool and powered, since it lacks the rest of Iapetus's infrastructure. It would make excellent substrate to run a Seed AI on.


-Element 115 (Call Of Duty - Zombies) (600CP)
        A metal container, containing an assortment of various forms of Element 115. This stuff can do all sorts of things, but it's dangerous, so use it wisely. The contents of the container will regenerate once a month.
        * Can be used to upgrade any weapon


-X-1000 Chip (Small Soldiers) (600CP)
        Woah, WOAH THERE BUDDY! Calm down, I know what this looks like. Yes this is the microchip originally designed to improve the tracking & tech on the US military's armaments. It was shut down for a variety of reasons, until being purchased and used without knowing full detail by two knucklehead toy designers who were rushing a deadline. Let me explain how the chip works, alright? By itself, it's nothing. Useless. It has no coding or power to it on its own. But when you incorporate it with something like say, a smart missile or a reactionary action figure, the X-1000 serves to enhance the latent programming. How much does it enhance? Well, the Elites and Gorgonites pretty much became sapient in all but legal rights. Please be careful with this. And, as I know you're going to ask this one comes with the blueprints / schemata for manufacturing more of the Chips, whereas the old plans were trashed.


-Advanced Materials Upgrade Kit | Lathe-Wrought Armour Plating Kit (Light of Terra DLC 4 - Lords of the Iron Line) (700CP)
        Advanced Materials Upgrade Kit (300CP)
        Plasteel, adamantium, armourplas, synth-leather and other sophisticated materials are used for all sorts of purposes within the Imperium, and are typically far more resilient than their archaic equivalents. Archaic styles of armour are seldom effective against advanced weapons, and rarely used in any case, but many of those who hail from primitive cultures favour the styles of wargear they are accustomed to. Wrought from plasteel and armourplas instead of bronze, iron and steel, a suit of chain or plate can be a quite effective defence, often the equal of more modern armours.
        Lathe-Wrought Armour Plating Kit (400CP)
        The astronomical and gravitational alignment of the Lathe worlds creates the conditions for the production of metal alloys of rare and singular properties. Lathe armour plating is strong and light, flexible enough to withstand the most powerful blows, and even resistant to intense heat or the crackling edge of a power weapon. The cost and rarity of such an upgrade is beyond the means of most individuals, with maybe only half a dozen sets of Lathewrought armour upgrade kits constructed in a decade, each created under commission for a specific wearer.




 --- Domain: Supplies: Magical Small Scale (10) (67 Perks) --- 


-Gems (Touhou Luna Nights) (50CP)
Magic crystals that somehow improve your abilities, though not all that much until you start stacking a great deal of them. Every purchase gives you one hundred and fifty amethysts (which improve your graze rewards), thirty aquamarines (which improve the rate at which your MP recovers), fifteen topazes (which improves your special ability recovery rate), eight rubies (which improve your defence), seven sapphires (which improves your attack power), five emeralds (which helps your health to recover), and one diamond (which improves both attack and defence, twice as much as rubies and sapphires do). Additionally, they can be used to power monsters and traps, with more powerful ones requiring higher quality gems, if you know how to use them.
-Mamono Realm Ink (Monster Girl Encyclopedia) (50CP)
A collection of inks made from minerals in various demon realms, with varying magic properties.  These enchantments can range from protecting the words from physical wear to preventing anyone from tampering with the letter to even charms that send the words and feelings of the message straight into the reader’s head, eroding and charming the reader’s heart with passionate desire. However, the magical effect contained in this ink will not manifest in an insincere nonsense sentence, and you also cannot make someone believe in a lie.
-Stabilized Moonsilver (Exalted - The Lunars) (50CP)
        Deposits of Moonsilver form only in the Wyld. Beams of moonlight unpredictably illuminate a region of the Bordermarches or Middlemarches, boiling off the Wyld and distilling its Essence into the fluid, watery-looking moonsilver. However, raw moonsilver is unstable. An artisan needs special techniques to work it. Through coaxing songs and careful taps and strokes with crystal hammers and probes, the artisan quiets the Wyldness remaining in the raw moonsilver so it becomes a stable metal. Pacify it too much and it freezes into silver; hit it too hard, and it shatters into drops of quicksilver.
        This does mean that in other worlds, you might have some difficulty finding any quantities of Moonsilver to use. Therefore, you may purchase a supply of moonsilver here. Gaining five Talents of pure, stabilized Moonsilver for you to use, enough for the creation of most any kind of artifact, as well as notes detailing the thaumaturgical procedure that may be used to create Moonsilver yourself. In the future, you will gain another five Talents of this mutable metal every year, ensuring that you will never permanently run out.


-Building Blocks (Paper Mario) (100CP)
A collection of mushroom kingdom brick blocks, yellow blocks, stone blocks, metal blocks, and empty ? blocks that can be filled with whatever you wish. You receive a large stockpile of each, and they replenish once a month. Feel free to use them however you wish.


-Dye and Paint (Terraria - Journey's End) (100CP)
        A selection of paints and dyes that can be used to color various objects or furniture. Each hue has enough to paint two or three objects, and restocks in a day once used. This also comes with a set of brushes, rollers, and scrapers that you can use to apply or remove the dyes and paints. To start with, you have all of the basic, bright, deep, and gradient hues. You gain the strange, lunar, shadow, negative, and illuminant hues.


-Elemental Seeds (World Seed) (100CP)
        An elemental seed is the condensed essence of an element, and they're almost exclusively produced by Druids or Mages capable of creating enchantments replicating their methods. They have various uses, such as powering enchantments or magical items, and are required in the process of giving an object an elemental ability. Druids also use them to introduce new elements into their Grove, and need them to cultivate their affinities past the 25% point. As such, each of them is fairly valuable, with the price skyrocketing once you go beyond the basic seven elements and to incredibly rare ones such as Time.
        They are also pretty time intensive to make, requiring about an hour of work for each, even for people relatively skilled in their creation. But now, you won't ever have to worry about that, as you'll get a dozen Seeds for each of your affinities delivered either to your warehouse or another place you designate, every week. Their quality depends on the level of your affinities: from 5% to 25% you'll get low-grade ones, from 25% to 50% medium-grade ones, from 50% to 75% high-grade ones, and finally, from 75% up to 100% you'll get top-grade seeds.


-Endless Bag of Glowstone(Minecraft) (100CP)
        You get a small bag which inexplicably contains a full stack of Glowstone Dust. It refills once a week. Handy for lighting up your surroundings, keeping the monsters at bay.


-Endless Bag of Redstone (Minecraft) (100CP)
        You get a small bag which inexplicably contains a full stack of Redstone. It refills once a week. Handy for experiments with Redstone Wiring.


-Honkai Cubes (Honkai Impact Third) (100CP)
        You have a supply of Honkai Cubes and know how to make more. Crystallized Honkai energy that when used to make or enhance weapons, gear, or anything really far enhances it beyond normal limits of human capabilities. Of course just having them does nothing, and if you just slap it on a low quality weapon it wont go very far. But with proper application of skill and infusion you can use these to create incredible things. Just beware potential feedback. Not intended to be fed to Tunas.


-Magical Ore (Everyone Else is a Returnee) (100CP)
        What is a smith without some metal to work with? Equipment plays a large part in this world, and a craftsman can only do so much without good materials. Luckily you happen to have a large storage box filled with lumps of unrefined ores of many varieties. The rarity and valuability of these ores range from normal iron all the way to precious ores of heaven, with the quantity of the ores being inversely proportional to their value. As you travel to future jumps, this box will update to include for the various ores you encounter. I hope you have some way of refining and forging them. Each month, the box will refill.


-Monster Hunted (Everyone Else is a Returnee) (100CP)
        Metal and stone are only a small group of materials used in the creation of equipment. Much more prevalent is the use of the flesh of monsters. From the feathers to the fur to the blood of them, every part of a monster can be used for something by a skilled craftsman. Luckily you just so happen to have a replenishing supply of monster bits. You can choose the class of monster flesh you receive, though the stronger the material the less of it will be supplied.
        You may only get a handful of 5th class feathers, while you could get a metric ton of 1st class scales. New material is supplied each month. Among these you may even get some magic cores.


-Pixie Dust (Peter Pan) (100CP)
        Most if not all fairies constantly produce the magical substance of fairy dust around their body, such that a trail follows wherever you fly. People and even objects as large as ships, when covered in the sparkling dust, gain the ability to fly. However, while inanimate things can fly without any challenge, people wishing to fly must have sincere faith and happy, carefree emotions. You can constantly emit pixie dust at will and even surround you with a cloud of fairy dust. The perk also enables you to breathe easily without choking on pixie dust or other particles, such that you could breathe and talk even with smoke all around you. If you are not a fairy, you will be looked at quite strangely by others, but things are often strange in Neverland so that's hardly a bad thing.


-Raw Materials (Elder Scrolls Online) (100CP)
        About 20 ingots worth of dwemer metal, a few honing stones, and a set of hammers and tongs. Used materials refill once a year. Not exactly powerful in the more high-tech settings, but being able to craft items out of a metal that never really rusts is something that won't ever go out of style. Or you could always just sell it off. This is almost 600 crowns worth of eternally respawning refined metal and smithing equipment just sitting on the ground after all.


-Sack of the Maker (Arifureta Shokugyou de Sekai Saikyo) (100CP)
        Medium sized, this bag contains an assortment of random ores and metals for you to work with, from cheap iron to Tauru ore which is one of the hardest known ores around, the quality and quantity of these materials will vary from day to day and sometime will drop some really precious minerals. It refills once a day so don't get shy at using them.


-Snifit (Paper Mario) (100CP)
Snifits are special shy guys who have specially modified masks that allow them to fire projectiles made from nightmares. These bullets can be fired one at a time or in a barrage of three, and yes they are made of nightmares. I guess that means if you had a method of storing nightmares you could use them to create stronger projectiles or ones with special properties. Channeling nightmares into bullets requires the expenditure of flower [magic] points.


-Soul Gems (Elder Scrolls Online) (100CP) 
An essential tool for enchanters and mages, yet one that's only recently gained formal recognition. You have five Petty, four Common and Lesser, three Greater and Grand, and two Black soul gems all held in a tasteful keshweed fiber satchel. Each gem holds a soul of its corresponding size, color, and power. For example, a Petty gem would hold a rabbit or a small dog at most, while a Grand would hold a mammoth or a strong Daedra. These are both White souls and can be held in White gems. The rarer Black soul gems hold the souls of sapient creatures, like humans, beast folk, or elves. You can use them as arcane batteries, as focuses for spells, or just as general magic storage. You'll get a new set every month of whatever's been depleted. Remember to be careful handling the Black gems, as they can have unfortunate and potentially lethal side-effects if not contained properly.


-Story Water Extractor (Haroun and the Sea of Stories) (100CP)
        All of Kahani rests on an ocean made of stories, and every Guppee uses it for one thing or another. Truly, it is the spiritual source of life in all the worlds, from which dreams, ideas, and words are granted life. Aside from granting stories and dreams to drinkers, the water has many magical uses, depending on how creatively you use the resource. This perk gives you in-depth knowledge on how to draw out and use story water from the plentiful Streams of Story. Furthermore, in later worlds you now have the ability to find and extract story water, which will always be somewhere one way or another (but without the perk, it will be impossible to find this metaphysical sea unless an equivalent already canonically exists). There are countless uses for the liquid, so feel free to experiment as you please. Just keep in mind that the state and availability of story water, just like the treatment of stories themselves, varies between worlds; be careful that you don't drink polluted water, or your dreams might take a turn for the worse. On the other hand, story water from certain magical worlds, particularly those built on stories, may be exceptionally potent.


-Portable Examination Station (Van Helsing) (150CP)
        A portable study centre - magnifying glass, vials, all held within a tightly-locked briefcase. As well, comes with a variety of supernatural samples - from vials of different blood types of demons and werewolves, to vampire fangs, demonic horn shavings, ghoul teeth, and ectoplasm from a great variety of undead.


-Adamantium (X-Men Evolution) (200CP)
        You receive a case of liquid adamantium which is the hardest material in this world. This nigh-indestructible metal once solidified in anything won't be melted and is practically impossible to destroy. You contain more than enough to do something like Weapon X and still have plenty left over. You'll of course receive more adamantium whenever you run out.


-Asarakam and Yoma Samples (Claymore) (200CP)
        This is an unending supply of samples from both awakened, and unawakened Asarakam, by combining them together you can create another form of parasitic life that can infect humans turning them into Yoma. This supply also includes yoma flesh and blood, just because you might not want to bother with the other steps.


-Beauty Leads To Death (Duel Monsters - Duel Terminal Part 1) (200CP)
        Ah, what a pure soul you are. Untainted, shining with a gentle light like morning snowflakes refracting the ephemeral rays of the rising sun. To corrupt it and bring you to the depths of vileness would be such a pleasure ahem. This pure soul of yours, besides looking rather pretty to anyone with the appropriate senses, makes you a rather fitting sacrifice. Even just a mouthful of blood taken from you as payment could have effects similar to an entire life's taking and that's assuming you don't have any special traits that might raise your value. Still, that type of thing could get you killed easily, so you've figured out how to hide or negate all of these traits as a necessity for survival.


-Bottomless Bucket (Terraria - Journey's End) (200CP)
        A fairly large metal bucket, which, when filled with a liquid, can pour out infinite amounts of said liquid unless deliberately completely emptied. It will resist cold, heat, corrosion, and other damaging properties of whatever liquid fills it, and when deliberately emptied, no traces or cross-contamination will happen when the bucket is refilled.


-Burgeoning Whirlflame ( Duel Monsters - Duel Terminal Part 2) (200CP)
        The flame in your heart gives you strength, but you are not the only one who can draw upon this potence. You are magical. Even a pound of your body would function as a reagent of reasonable quality, and that's assuming whoever was using pieces of you didn't bother playing to your strengths. As a Laval, you would be a source of high quality materials for any mages wishing to produces potions or equipment aspected to fire. Given the changes to your nature, and the powers you might wield, through acquisitions in other worlds well, you'd certainly be a prized catch. Who knows what someone willing to kill the golden goose by using you in your entirety could achieve? Ah, in case you're worried: you can freely control this new feature of yours, and decide who can benefit from it and how. Without your consent, none can even learn you hold this hidden power.


-Canteen of Magical Supply (Monster Girl Encyclopedia) (200CP)
A seemingly-empty canteen that readily produces water whenever mana is applied to the canteen to power it up.  The canteen normally produces normal water, but extensive exposure to specific kinds of energy can cause the water to be infused with that energy; however, your canteen (unlike most others available in-setting) has a remarkable filter, so the canteen will not become permanently locked on a specific energy or permanently tainted by one unless you want it so – instead, once the corruptive energy is gone, it will go back to producing regular, untainted water.


-Charms, Talismans and Sutras (The Irregular At The Magic Highschool) (200CP)
        This is a supply of ingredients for Ancient Magic, including prepared spell cards, spirit charms and various talismans. They replenish each day after being used.


-Crate of adamantine (Dungeon Keeper Ami) (200CP)
        Adamantine, the rare metal forged by the dwarves of the frozen north. This metal is the result of a dreadful battle between the gods of light and the gods of darkness, this metal is all that remains of a once mighty god of light that fell to earth while killing a dark god, after many years his flesh was changed and warped till it became the metal adamantine, nearly impossible to forge without the correct knowledge this metal is nearly indestructible and harms creatures of evil like fire while blocking dark magic completely. You now have a crate of this amazing metal and shall receive a new crate once a year. Though this may not seem like much especially with the requirements on forging it, you need not worry. This Adamantine will work as if it were normal steel up until its first forging after which its normal


-Crystal Concepts (Kingdom Hearts) (200CP)
        You possess the unusual ability to find tangible concepts, often used in this setting to create items through Synthesis. Nothingness, evil, darkness, light, sadness etc. You can now find distilled physical versions of normally abstract concepts left behind by defeated enemies, or hidden in obscure and hard to reach places. These concepts are typically related to the place or enemies you obtain the from, such as fiery enemies or locales holding Fire Shards, or a lightning dragon dropping a Lightning Crystal. The quality of the item depends on the difficulty of obtaining it, ranging from Shards from weak enemies, up to Stone, Gem, and finally Crystal for the progressively tougher enemies. What you do with them is up to you; they'd make nice jewellery, that's true, but I'm sure you can find a better use for crystallised fire or hope. In jump this means you find significantly more Synthesis ingredients you can either use, or sell.


-Endless bag of nether warts (Minecraft) (200CP)
        You get a small bag which inexplicably contains a full stack of Nether Wart. It refills once a week. The crucial ingredient in all Minecraft potions, brew it with water and any of a vast array of ingredients to create a magical potion. Also comes with a Brewing Stand.


-Grathmeld Supplies (Ar Tonelico) (200CP)
        You receive a 1m white ceramic cube, which contains 250 kilograms of randomised base components and Grathnode crystals. Stocks replenish every week, and ratios skew towards whatever ingredients you used the most of.


-Iron Rose (Circle of Magic) (200CP)
        You gain a rose bush made of living iron. If placed in contact with a pure sample of any metal, it will generate buds and eventually roses of that metal. Such roses can be harvested, then planted to transform more and more of that metal into living metal slowly over time. They must be planted in soil rich in that metal, or in a pot full of clay and chunks of said metal to grow properly. Should you tend these roses long enough for them to bear seeds, the plants that grow from these seeds will transform base metals into whatever metal they grew from.


-Magic MetaMaterials (With this Ring) (200CP)
        We hear about swords and armor made of Orihalcum, Mithril, and Jovium, but there are far better uses for these wondrous materials. Jovium is a perfect conductor of heat and electricity, Orihalcum and Mithril hold a magical charge and enchantment far more effectively than ordinary materials, and both are far stronger than their weight would suggest for metals. You receive a metric ton of these three metals for use in any military or industrial project you like, and instructions for producing more. The process, however, of synthesizing common alloys into magical metamaterials requires either a familiarity with metal typically found in journeyman level craftsmen who shape metal such as blacksmiths, welders, and jewelers, or familiarity with arcane practices found in journeyman level enchanters or artificers.


-Monster Killing Metals (Percy Jackson And The Olympians) (200CP)
        About ten pounds of Celestial Bronze, Imperial Gold or Stygian Iron. All made to destroy godly and monstrous creatures (save the last, which also hurts mortals) weapons crafted from these materials are incredibly durable and able to hold enchantments of the like seen in ancient myth. Your supply restocks every two weeks, with the type of metal it delivers being your choice.


-Noh Mask (Golden Sky Stories) (200CP)
A set of masks depicting people of different ages, Kabuki actors commonly switch between these masks to depict themselves as different characters during a play. In such a fashion, a single actor may become multiple people, though this is really more of a testament to the actor’s skill. When worn these masks will make others believe you are the individual depicted in the mask. This swap occurs seamlessly even if you put the mask on in front of people, but be wary that individuals with paranormal capabilities may be able to see through it.
You may customize these masks accordingly, but be wary that the masks can be rather sensitive, so it is best that you leave it to an artist to make a proper modification – or it could lead to some rather peculiar situations if your artistic capacity happens to be...sub-par.


-Onmyo Supplies (Fate/Legends - Land Of The Rising Sun) (200CP)
        A woven pack containing a large number of normally expensive supplies needed for proper Onmyouji craft. A seemingly unlimited amount of high quality paper, ink and scribing tools are within as a start, the basics needed for most spells in this field. Beyond these, are a large number of premade charms and shikigami that can be released from the pack on command. These can serve as emergency wards, alarms and shields when in a bind. Moderately powerful on their own, they can hold off a demon or band of men for a few minutes while you escape. The shikigami, numbering a few dozen in small paper forms, are able to act as capable spies and messengers over long ranges. When combined into one, they turn into a large animal such as a tiger or wyvern, a powerful combatant that can defend you against even a decently powerful hero for a few minutes before crumbling. The charms and shikigami replenish a week after being used.


-Ore Merchant (Dark Souls 2) (200CP)
        You have just gained the partnership of a travelling merchant, one who has an inventory that you're sure to find interesting. This travelling merchant sells a bizarrely large quantity of exotic stones with you getting a special discount. You always seem to be able to find them when you look hard enough, though never in the direct line of danger. While their inventory is always bizarrely large, you can still buy them out if you have the currency to back it up, whatever that may be locally. If you do, they'll disappear for a while to restock. In future worlds they will continue to sell the various stones and ores of this world such as Titanite or Boltstone, but will also temporarily stock themselves with whatever earthen curiosities can be found in the world around them. Limited time offers! They're practically giving this stuff away!


-Philosopher’s Stone (I Saved Too Many Girls And Caused the Apocalypse) (200CP)
        One of alchemy's greatest secrets and goals. Can be used as a core to create homunculi, make special alchemical compounds or even cure for any and all diseases. The philosopher's stone is one and yet all. All and yet one. A single philosopher's stone can serve any function, but it cannot be separated from its purpose, so you can't separate it or use it for multiple things at once.


-Sacks of Essences (Divinity - Original Sin) (200CP)
        These five head sized burlap sacks are extremely light despite the fact they look to be filled to bursting and each emits a faint light from the seams, a different color coming from each. A fiery red, a gentle blue, a brilliant white, a somber brown, and... is that fifth one emitting shadows? Small balls of solidified elemental essences are not a rare commodity in Rivellon and have a huge variety of uses in everything from specialized grenades to magical arrow heads to even aiding in enchanting arms and armor. Each sack contains five balls of each element and the sacks refill themselves every week. What use you put these concentrated bits of elemental magic is limited only by your imagination and experimentation. Just don't get opposing elements too close to each other. The result is fairly explosive, doubly so if you are enchanting at the time.


-Soft Stick (World Seed) (200CP)
        One of the technological staples in Neolife, these special devices are basically CDs for magic. Each Soft Stick is capable of holding a single program that can be erased or replaced as needed. Once a program is uploaded, the aura of the Soft Stick will shift to match it, making it an easy matter to convert any software you might write into a magical formation or enchantment with the same effect, and even doing things such as transferring an AI to an enchantment wouldn't be much trouble. Furthermore, since the companion bracelet is a suitable terminal to upload software to and from, you wouldn't even need any other equipment. With this purchase, you gain an endless supply of these useful little things, working with any code or software you might write, no matter how obscure or complicated.


-Songstone Composer (Ar Tonelico) (200CP)
        Another 1m cube. This produces the essential elements of Song Science, in the form of 1 ton each week of Songstone rubble, a crystalline ore of Parameno, Grathnode and Ardel. By itself, Songstone converts sound into magic, storing it until a threshold is reached and it explodes in a burst of wild energy - making them effective improvised grenades. Extracted and refined, their true potential can be reached. Parameno absorbs sound as magic, Grathnode emits it as magic, and Ardel acts as a semiconductor.


-Sticker Album (Paper Mario) (200CP)
This book resembles the ones used by stamp collectors across the multiverse. This one is full of all kinds of stickers from the sticker comet. The stickers within can be pulled out with ease and used with the paperize technique to generate all kinds of effects. Its pages refill weekly, but the stickers within are always random. Sometimes you may only have weak stickers, whereas other times you will have plenty of the more powerful kinds. Unique stickers, such as the royal stickers, will not be generated by this album but can be stored within.


-Vibranium Sample (Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1) (200CP)
        Vibranium is an extremely rare element that possesses unique attributes. In a pure mass, vibranium forms a solid metal that is stronger than steel, but only a third of the weight, as well as being completely vibration absorbent. This means it can absorb the impacts of a great deal of attacks, but bear in mind high-energy attacks WILL do damage... especially if it is consistent. Purchasing this gets you a container a foot in length with some Wakandan Vibranium shards that will replenish itself every month.


-Woden's Blood (Uber) (200CP)
        An unrefined sample of the world shaking substance used to catalyse the transformation from normal human to superhuman weapon, containing eight portions. Each portion can, with proper knowledge and technology, be refined to be used as any one unit of catalyst of the basic activation sequences. Alternatively the entire eight portions can be refined for use in one of the Special Activations.
        Replenishes once per month. Acts as a highly lethal contact poison to any person without the potential to receive Activations. Using an unrefined portion of Woden's Blood on a person with the potential to receive further Activations grants half a Physical and Halo Activation each and has the chance to horribly deform the recipient.


-An Artificer's Dream (Generic Exalted) (300CP)
        Pick a magical material from the following of Jade, Orichalum, Starmetal, Soulsteel, Moonsilver, and Adamant. You now have a source of it provided for you in your warehouse every week, roughly 50lbs worth. If you pick Jade you get 50lbs of each of the five types of Jade. None of this stuff is actually made into anything yet but if you've got the crafting skills you could easily change that. If you pick Starmetal note that you'll probably have the largest (and only regenerating) source of Starmetal in all of Creation. Don't let your enemies find out. In fact, don't let anyone find out you have a regenerating source of any of these materials, whole nations have been put to the torch for less. Magical Materials are incredibly useful, and critical, in the construction of artifacts.
* Price includes stock of all 6 magical materials.
-Arcane Resources (Ravenwood) (300CP)
        A supply of high quality, magically-active materials. Such materials are useful in the process of casting spells of various sorts, able to act as foci for various spells, or can be used in the creation of potions or artefacts (as described in the Natural Magic perk). Comes with several schematics for potions and artefacts that can be made with these materials. Additionally, this comes with a travel case that can contain up to 16 potions. Potions contained within this imprint to the slot they are placed in for the next 24 hours, at which point the potions respawn the day after they are used. Placing a different potion in the slot allows it to imprint the new potion.


-Mana Gems (World Seed) (300CP)
        One rather important power source used in many energy-hungry magitech devices, and also popular with mages and enchanters, are mana gems. But due to their nature, they cannot be artificially created, only forming after several years of mana condensing and purifying in a single location. This commonly happens only on asteroids, where they can be left undisturbed for long periods of time, and truly vast mana veins can form. But even as mining them can be a hassle, their value makes it worth anyone's while, as they are capable of holding and regenerating massive amounts of mana, with the exact volumes depending on the gem's size and quality. And it seems like you've hit the jackpot, as with this you'll be able to gain a steady supply of mana gems each week. You may decide on a case by case basis whether you want several dozen small and low-quality mana gems, or two to three big and high-quality ones.


-Super Sea Snails (Splatoon) (300CP)
        You have a small breeding population of around 10 Super Sea Snails, large snails with crystalline, conical shells. The snails are hermaphroditic and they live for around 15 years. They're more than they seem, they provide an invaluable service- Their shells can be used to imbue hats, shirts, and pairs of shoes with extra Ability Slots, or reroll the abilities of a clothing item with 3 full slots. This kills the Sea Snail, but if you're careful to keep up the population then eventually you might have an entire wardrobe of 3-slot clothing. Also, they're delicious when cooked right.


-The Holy Grail (Iron sky) (300CP)
        Well now. This is a cup weighing 84 ounces, an endless source of the wonder chemical known as Vril. Vril is a chemical that is behind all of the Vrilian technology in this world, providing unlimited energy, immortality, regeneration and incredibly heightened physical abilities.
        With a direct drink from this vessel you would be instantly cured of all ailments, and your physical strength is raised to such heights that you can kill a T-Rex with one hit. Plugged in as a power source, which is as simple as dipping wires in it, the grail provides an unlimited amount of any and all energies you might care to ask of it. Even chocolates made of it are enough to reverse decades of aging and fix any diseases plaguing the body. You also get an unlimited supply of these chocolates.


-Aethertapping (Aion) (400CP)
        You have been taught how to extract Aether from vortices, which can then be used by daeva to catalyze their crafting. Post-Jump, you will be able to find the occasional vortice-like anomaly spread across the setting seemingly at random, which you will be able to draw aether out of. They'll be invisible and undetectable to anyone who doesn't have this perk, however.
        You have mastery in this art, and make post-jump vortice-anomalies considerably more common.


-Alchemical Foundry | Mythic Forge | Dust Refinery | Arcane Smelter (Endless Legend) (400CP)
        Alchemical Foundry (50CP)
        You gain the equipment needed to extract, process, and refine Titanium and Glassteel. It exacts about one ingot a week.
        Mythic forge (150CP)
        You possess the tools to gather, refine, and process Mithrite and Hyperium. Good luck finding it, much less finding some that others haven't already claimed.
        Dust Refinery (100CP)
        Able to infuse Dust with new life, the Refinery is the staple of Dust Enchantment. While Dust infused iron is common, it pales compared to the Dust enchantments this refinery allows. Allows for the crafting of Foci and magic rings, talismans, insignias, and tomes.
        Arcane Smelter (100CP)
        A self-contained device used to extract, process, and refine Palladium and Adamantium. A must have for the smith on the go.


-Bag of Junk (Divinity - Original Sin) (400CP)
        A large sack that seemed filled with the oddest assortment of trash and rubbish you've ever seen. There's a bottle of mud that seems to swirl inside its jar no matter how hard you shake it or how long you leave it to rest on a shelf. There's an amulet of battered tin in the shake on a buffalo. There's a shrivelled old heart that somehow is still weakly beating and warm to the touch. There's even an old sabre in here, rusted and chipped and all but falling apart. Seriously, what is all this even good for?
        * The Notes say that stuff is used to craft legendary swords in the game


-Divine Metals (Marvel Magic) (400CP)
        You have somehow managed to procure a supply of one of two divine ores. Either you have somehow gained access to 100 gallons of either Uru or Adamantine in a liquid state.


-Forbidden Treasure (Generic Exalted) (400CP)
        You looking for some weird stuff? Maybe the bottled laughter of a newborn infant, or the dream of a maddened artist? How about the color of the sunset as seen from a specific mountain peak found only in The South? Well if you buy this option you'll have those things. 200cp gets you a regular source every week in your warehouse of relatively hard to find exotic resources and reagents which can be used to dramatically aid in the speed and efficiency of artifact creation. For 400cp you get a larger amount every week of far more exotic things. Trapped Essence of Yozi, a fragment of the twisted dreams of the Neverborn, and a thousand and one things never before seen or imagined spawned from the twisting madness found only in the absolute heart of the Wyld. You may direct what specific kind of resource you get each week if you have some specific need or desire in mind, and may freely choose something different the next week.


-Gemavic (Gemcraft-Frostborn Wrath) (400CP)
        This perk allows you to summon gems made of different materials using gemcraft, including materials from other jumps. This only works if the material is a transparent or translucent crystal, unfortunately. Most materials are much worse for conducting magic than crystalized mana, but perhaps you can find a use for a diamond the size of a living room? Non-Magical gems are exceptionally cheap to create you know, since they're essentially sparkly paperweights. Feel free to be creative with shapes.


-Mini-Hakkero (Touhou Forbidden Hermit) (400CP)
You have a mystical, magical furnace shaped like an octagon and made of hihi’irokane. Each corner is emblazoned with a different trigram with different powers, such as generating a lot of heat, producing a cool breeze for hot days, and the ability to amplify magic through it to blast a Master Spark – enough to reduce a mountain to ashes. As such a potent magical item, it’s very handy for magical research too.


-Oni Treasures (Touhou Forbidden Hermit) (400CP)
You have in your possession the four treasures of the Oni. The first is the Ibuki Gourd, a stylish large purple gourd with a stopper that has been soaked in the extract of a Sake Bug. Even a little bit of water in here somehow multiplies into a vast quantity of sake, though it never produces more than the gourd can hold at a time. With this treasure, you could easily ensure you never spend another moment of your life sober. The second is Douju’s Jar, a large waist-high pot full of an endless amount of edible oil with no unusual properties beyond tasting smooth and nice. Perhaps you might want to establish a deep-frying business? The third is the Hoshiguma Dish, a simple red sake dish that has the miraculous ability to raise the quality of any sake poured into it, making it taste much better and be far easier to drink. Note that the sake does not need to remain in the dish to benefit from the increased quality; pouring it into the dish and then pouring it out into another container is a perfectly valid way to amass a lot of high-quality sake. However, sake can only benefit from its blessing once. The fourth, and most potent, is the Ibaraki Box of a Hundred Medicines, a decorated sake box that can hold two litres of liquid at a time. Should a healthy person drink alcohol from the sake box, it temporarily grants them the strength of an Oni for a day at the price of shifting their personality to be like an Oni’s (read: crude, brash, coarse, loud and belligerent) until it wears off. If a sick, injured or otherwise unhealthy person drinks from it, however, it cures all of their ailments barring incurable mutilation from powerful magical relics at the small cost of permanently transforming their body into that of an Oni – though some might say this is simply another bonus. If a lot of people were to drink from this box, you can be assured it would cause incredible amounts of chaos.


-Painting Book (Wonderland No More) (400CP)
A watercolor set (with case, brush and paints) that comes with a couple-dozen-page book full of outlined drawings of various Wonderland beings and landscapes, waiting to be colored in. Once you’ve fully colored in the picture, the subject “comes to life” just as it was painted, right in front of the painter.  These painting creations are fully loyal to the painter, though you can command them to behave like the real-life versions would.  Each colored picture is replaced by a new drawing outline in a day (the random pictures all generally depict various things from Wonderland).


-Potted Stardust (Divinity - Original Sin) (400CP)
        The Stardust plant is a hardy, quick growing flower with peachy-red colored petals standing up on spindly stalks with large, wide fern-like leaves growing from the base. It is highly sought after by women who use the golden dust that clings to its flower petals to enhance their beauty, but that is only the least of its uses. The golden dust is highly magical and can be easily used for crafting a variety of magical items. Everything from magical swords to voodoo dolls can be created with a pouch full of this stuff. The flower in this pot will generate one small pouch of dust every few days and will never need tending to. Should it be killed, a fresh pot will appear in your proximity within a week.


-Ritual Pigments (Dishonored 2) (400CP)
        A selection of paint pigments in more than a dozen colours, each colour conveniently prepared from precise ingredients and according to very specific methods needed to use paintings as a ritual for conducting sympathetic magic no need to wait for certain phases of the moon, nor collect certain weeds in a container made of a human skull. Put simply, what you paint in the painting can be imposed onto reality, or what is in reality can be transferred into the painting.
        There are enough pigments here to do one painting which affects a room-sized area, allowing goods to be conjured, things within the area to be altered or removed, or to turn the painting itself into a room-sized pocket dimension. You could paint a painting of an empty room and add in a pile of silver to the painting, to sympathetically conjure a pile of silver into the real room, or you could paint a picture of the room without its door, which will magically remove the door from the wall of the real room, preventing all access.
        Unfortunately painting ephemeral things such as souls, magic, auras or power still does not make them appear in reality. You could also use these paints to move something out of reality and into the painting, such as valuables or a prisoner, concealing or trapping them inside it. If you should possess Voidheart and Endless Black, you will find the scale of this power magnified so you could create an entire world of phantasy within the painting to enter, or call forth from your canvas a change to affect an entire city.


-Seeds of Potential (Exalted - The Infernals) (400CP)
        Just as Malfeas has its own forms of vegetation, so too does it have its own forms of farming. These plants tend to be made of metals such as tin or brass, though the will of a powerful demon can result in other substances. As the woods of Creation, these metal-woods can be set aflame, albeit only through a specific method employing a firedrill, logs from Vitalius or Hrotsvitha, and demon ichor. Other sorts of fire will not ignite metallic Malfean vegetation, and their metallic flames might melt other sorts of fuel but will not set them afire. Paper will not burn on a fire of metallic logs, and would only be heated. If smelted and cast into new form, the metals of Malfeas lose this property. Their means of cultivation also diverge greatly from those found in Creation. Malfean crops rarely require anything so simple as plowing, sowing and reaping. Instead, they might require to be grown from human finger bones planted in the ground, bear fruit only to the beating of drums, or release their harvest only at the sacrifice of a living demon.
        Now I will offer to you a collection of five kinds of seeds. One kind of the ivy of gray lead, one of the bloodmelon vines, one of the malice-nut tree, one of the squash vines of black porcelain, and one of the brass-stemmed roses with petals of green-black glass that grow only in rare parts of hell. All of these will grow where you will, as long as they are properly cared for, and the collection will replenish in number in case you wish to start additional gardens.
        And lastly, I shall offer you these three seeds of potential, harvested from Oramus' slumbering temple-body. While they come in lesser number, and will not be replaced as the collection of lesser seeds will be, they are far more remarkable. For if they are pierced by a spike of metal or any other material and planted in the ground, and then regularly fed with a prayer for its growth, these will grow into the seedlings of new trees or plants incorporating the spike's materials. Of course, as a new species you'll have to discover the ways to cultivate them further yourself, and the rarer materials may give you more difficulty... but with a wise selection of ores and minerals, it may be well worth it.


-Terragene Crystals (Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 2) (400CP)
        There's dangerous items, and then there's this thing. A relic from the Kree Empire, these crystals are often sealed inside a container called a Diviner in order to ensure the mist that these crystals spread is kept in check. Why so? Well, the mist causes any who contain the right genetic code to undergo Terrigenesis, where their body becomes enveloped in a stonelike cocoon before breaking open and granting superhuman powers... sometimes with physical changes to help. If they don't have the proper genetic code, then they merely turn to stone before crumbling into pieces. Do be careful.


-Twin Corns (Monster Girl Encyclopedia) (400CP)
Two hollowed out Bicorn horns that make for good drinking cups.  Whenever different liquids are poured into one of the cups, they are instantly mixed together.  Similarly, any energies applied to the cup are converted to a liquid form and mixed together; also, the energy of each individual person has its own unique flavor.  Each cup can hold up to three liquids together, but if you lock the two horns together and shake them, the liquids of both horns will merge, and you can use a small opening at the tip of either horn to drink the full cocktail – thus receiving the unique blend of different liquids/energy types fused together.


-Worldsinger (Warhammer 40k - Craftworld Eldar JumpChain) (400CP)
        The craft of the Bonesinger is mighty indeed, yes but as there are many notes in a song, so are there more uses for music than Wraithbone alone. In the way the Bonesinger shapes Wraithbone with psychic energy and their voice, so do you shape the green and growing things. Vegetation springs from the earth, seemingly from nothing, at the sound of your voice, molding itself to fit your needs. Should you grow hungry, bring forth fruit. Should you grow hot, bring forth shade. Should you grow weary, bring forth a bed of leaves. All these shall heed your song.


-Treasure Mimic (Dark Souls 3) (500CP)
        A large wooden chest divided into three compartments. The left compartment contains twenty pieces of Twinkling Titanite, the right compartment contains twenty Titanite Scales and the middle compartment contains assorted shards and chunks of normal Titanite.
        Titanite is a good, strong metal good for weapons and armor among other things, as well as reinforcing equipment. Twinkling Titanite is handy for the reinforcement of equipment steeped in strength, baring unique abilities, without diminishing those properties, though it's somewhat poor for crafting.
        Titanite Scales are left behind by Crystal Lizards that grow to immense sizes after devouring souls, and are the ideal material for reinforcing equipment made through Soul Transposition. All three being handy materials for a blacksmith though. Titanite originating from the chest will slowly replenish over time once used for something. The assorted normal Titanite will replenish one piece every hour or so, while the special varieties usually take a couple days per piece.
        In reality, the chest is a loyal mimic that guards these resources and whatever else you put inside. If need be, it can even reveal itself to fight a would-be thief or carry out simple instructions. When walking about, two long arms and a huge tongue protrude from the inside, teeth grow along the edges of the lid and a long, lanky, deceptively powerful body stretches out of the bottom.


-The Dragons Blessing (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - TG) (600CP)
        The pieces of the Spirit Dragons that wander Hyrule are truly potent, even their scales and pieces of their horn could easily take a mundane traveler's sword up to a hero's weapon! Their inherent magic and power is such that, for any crafting(from cooking to elixir mixing to weapon crafting to even casting enchantments) they are one of the best ingredients you can find. But the Spirit Dragons are elusive, and dangerous to harvest from. You have been gifted a small collection of Dragon parts to use at your leisure, which will replenish every fortnight.


-Crafting Materials, Supplies and Tools | Legendary Treasury (Overlord - The Series) (750CP)
        Crafting Materials, Supplies and Tools (600CP)
You have the good fortune of possessing a regenerating stock of high end crafting materials suitable across all fields of crafting, alongside the tools and workshop space in order to make something with them (you must supply the actual skill on your own however). Materials for low-end magical items (ie: Greater tier or below, as explained at the beginning of the item section) regularly resupply such that you could probably churn out hundreds of such items a day. Legacy tier materials would allow you to craft a few things a day. Materials for equipment at the Relic tier resupply often enough you could probably make a single relic tier item a day. This is the limit for the 300 CP option.
        For 600 CP however your materials now include enough for a single Legendary tier piece of equipment every two weeks or so, and the materials for a single piece of Divine Tier equipment would likely take at least two months. However, there is nothing preventing you from stockpiling the materials, as they'll keep resupplying themselves even if not used up. This may either be a warehouse attachment or attached to another property at your desire, either way it will always have enough space inside to store materials for crafting things, will always be neatly arranged, organized, and labeled, and will be perfectly capable of storing or maintaining even the most volatile or fragile of substances. Both levels of this option are discounted to those that have purchased the Crafting Class perk.
        Legendary Treasury (Overlord (The Series) Guild Base Supplement) (150CP)
Your guild base is famous, or perhaps infamous, for the mind boggling amount of treasure it contains within. Or it would be assuming anyone knew about it. You have enough Yggdrasil gold coins within to keep your guild base going for hundreds of years, and it is littered with powerful high tier magic items of all shapes and sizes, and an even more excessive number of low and mid tier magical items. Barring truly foolish spending habits or ruinous expenses you should likely never need to worry about your treasury running out of gold to support the guild base. In future worlds it will refill with equivalent amounts of gold, and new magic items suitable for the world it finds itself in. Additionally, and finally, it is now of arbitrary internal size. There will always be more room and more space to add in any treasures or items you come across, as the treasury will expand to fit them as you add them inside.
        If you or a Companion also purchased the Crafting Materials, Supplies, and Tools item from the regular Overlord (the series) jump document then this Legendary Treasury will also be filled with copious amounts of reagents and crafting materials, of appropriate qualities and levels for whatever version of the Crafting Materials, Supplies, and Tools option you purchased. In future worlds it will fill up with more as appropriate to the world(s) you've been to.


-Caloric Stone (Overlord - The Series ) (800CP)
        The actual origin or source of the Caloric Stone is a near total mystery. It forms only from large concentrations of the Seven Prismatic Ores, legendary divine materials that possess qualities far and away above anything else. Why this occurs, or even who first discovered the Caloric Stone, is unknown.
        While held, the Caloric Stone grants the usual benefits of a World Item upon its bearer, providing protections against negative status, instant death, being trapped or held, scryed upon, and so forth, trumping even the effects of other World Items. However, while useful, those are far and away the least impressive aspects of the stone. The truth of the matter is quite simple; the Caloric Stone is the ultimate crafting material. No matter what you are making, no matter how mighty, no matter what other materials are included, adding the Caloric Stone will make that item or bit of craftsmanship better.
        Food, drink, weapons, armor, buildings, vehicles, golems, indeed anything that can be crafted can be quantifiably made superior (by an astounding degree) by the inclusion of the Caloric Stone in its creation process, as the stone expands the possibilities and power of what can be done with crafting. If you were to use particularly mighty materials in the creation of something, say ingredients on par with those usually used in the making of a Divine Tier item, the resulting piece of equipment would be truly legendary, halfway between the status of a Divine tier item and a World Item. Obviously, and unfortunately, the stone is expended when used.
        However, since you're paying at a premium, you are guaranteed to receive a new Caloric Stone exactly one month after using it, appearing in whatever location is most convenient for you. You may explicitly hand this to other people but you need not fear losing it. If separated from your person in a fashion you didn't intend, it will appear in the closest convenient location for you a day later. However if it was used in this time frame to make something then you must still wait a month for it to respawn. The Caloric Stone is discounted for those that purchased the 600 CP option for Crafting Materials, Supplies, and Tools. The Caloric Stone is utterly unique, and cannot be duplicated or copied via any method whatsoever using in-jump methods.


-Golden Soul Pearl Bank (Coiling Dragon Panlong) (800CP)
        Golden Soul Pearls are small pearls each filled with the Soul Essence of countless people (20 million in fact), strengthening one's soul by a truly incredible amount, allowing their soul to be at the peak of their tier of power (God Highgod). The stronger the soul, the faster the insights into the profound mysteries. This item is a small box which appears in your warehouse that can hold up to 10 Golden Soul Pearls. Refills once every ten years. Comes with the peace of mind from knowing you didn't slaughter one hundred million people.
*Keep in mind you can't eat this willy nilly to get powerful if you are a mortal, you need to be strong enough in body and soul to be able to handle this kind of energy unless you want to explode. 






--- Domain: Supplies: Mundane Large Scale (11) (17 Perks) --- 




-Energy Crystal Generator (I have a mansion in the post apocalypse) (100CP)
        Energy crystals are the currency of the future, stonelike, hard crystals that are capable of holding gigantic amounts of energy of any and all kinds. They're used to fuel tanks, computers, powersuits, everything. And now you have a machine for making them!
        Simply by feeding this machine energy through any of the many input methods it has, you can create charged up crystals, holding that energy in convenient, packet-sized forms that are entirely safe to hold and use, no matter the kind of energy. You can generate these crystals through hooking the machine up to a power outlet, or you can use more... 'exotic' means.
        After all, in the Post Apocalypse full of mutants, the most plentiful source of energy are the mutants themselves. They're harvested for the energy crystals that develop on them, full ofthe radioactive energies that serve in various ways to fuel the industries of this world. Similarly, you can chuck basically anything into this device and if there's any kind of unique or exotic energy to be extracted from it,this machine will do it swiftly and easily.


-Fuel Production Facility (Starsector v1.2) (100CP)
        A large facility dedicated to the production of fuel. By default, the production facility is configured to produce antimatter fuel, but this can be changed to produce alternative variants of fuel at higher volumes. A single facility is capable of producing enough antimatter every month to supply around 10 capital-hull ships without a problem, or around 3000 units of fuel.


-Resource Generator (Toaruverse) (100CP)
        Buying materials and resources cost too much time and manpower, especially if the materials or resources that you need are limited or rare. You gain a warehouse full of materials and resources no matter how common to how rare it is that you need to build any technology that you want. It replenishes used materials every twenty-four hours after you take it out the warehouse, additionally it records and replenishes any materials that you add in your warehouse. After the jump it would become a warehouse add-on or be inserted near your starting location.
        * Gives a rapidly restocking warehouse which contains large amounts of anything that falls under materials and resources that is stored in your warehouse improving most perks that are listed under supplies.


-Mineral Rights (Diabolical) (200CP)
        You have, through some underhanded but fully legal means, acquired a metric ton of rights to various mines and harvesting operations the world over. In practical terms this means you will have a sufficient amount of raw metals, ores, minerals, and other physical resources to build or construct whatever you desire all without paying a dime for it. You can also sell the excess on the open or black market, or simply stockpile it all for yourself. This will follow you to other Jumps, providing a steady stream of physical resources and allowing you to live the life of a mining magnate, or always have sufficient resources for your industrial ambitions.
        * A rare perk in the celestial forge in that it gives direct ownership of something outside the warehouse that isn't a single building or a business.


-Vibration/Oscillation warhead (Arpeggio of Blue Steel) (200CP)
        Humanity's version of the Corrosive torpedo. Disintegrates the target at a molecular level by finding the target's 'resonance frequency' and literally vibrating it apart. The Vibration torpedo can defeat any armour made of normal matter nanomaterials or meter-thick steel, makes no difference, but can't punch through Klein fields on its own. Superior to the corrosive torpedo, the Vibration warhead requires no exotic matter or nanotech: it can be mass produced by any reasonably sophisticated factory. This is a full load for your vessel, plus the schematics.


-Eufiber tumor (Trinity:Aberrant) (300CP)
        Don't show this to anyone unless you want to deal with some very awkward questions. Somehow you've acquired a small piece of Anibal Buendia's tissue floating in a nutrient bath, or something very much like it, that secretes strands of living Eufiber. You can use the Eufiber to make Quantum-Attuning suits. Living Eufiber also interacts with other powers in strange ways it is known that cyberkinetic powers are boosted when working with computers linked by a Living Eufiber network they are Attuned to. Finding other uses for this material will require experimentation on your part.


-Store of Omni-Metals (DC - Larfleeze) (300CP)
        A cargo ship carrying 40 million cubic feet of omnimetal, enough to build several buildings' worth. They predate the current multiverse by a large margin, and are especially attuned to the nature of spatial dimensions. Because of this they're extremely useful in technology involving warping space and bridging between dimensions, making building such creations far easier than they would be otherwise. Your supply is restocked at the beginning of each jump or 10 years.
        * An absolutely massive cargo spaceship contains colossal amounts of restocking space and dimension bending metals which predate the creation of one of the DC Multiverses.


-Crystal Garden (Azeroth) (400CP)
        You now possess the very same crystals used by the Draenei in many of their creations. This single man sized crystal, when planted, can create a massive mine filled with even more crystals of varying shapes, sizes, and colors. The mine may be temporarily depleted if you harvest too much too quickly, but it will regenerate more crystals for you to harvest if given a month to rest. The crystals you mine from this can be planted into other areas to create new mines. However, these new mines will not regenerate after use and once empties the land will need time to replenish the necessary nutrients before you can plant more crystals. If you purchase The Mine then you will have an entire floor dedicated to these crystals within your mine.


-Junkyard (Mass Effect Andromeda) (400CP)
        Junk to some is treasure to others. You get a doorway that leads to a small pocket universe that is filled with the local area's lost, broken and/or discarded items. You might find broken gear, ruined vehicles, or maybe a pristine limited edition item that someone just forgot about. Everything in here will be somewhat useful to you, but you get to decide if it's use is as a source of resources, or if something is worth fixing.The doorway takes the appearance of an expandable hula hoop that opens a portal to the pocket universe.
        The pocket universe will refill with junk as you travel, or as the local area around you generates junk that will be siphoned off. In addition, if you haven't cleared out the junk universe in one jump, then you can still pick it up in another, while the junk from the new jump will slowly filter in as space is opened up.


-Need More (Blade Runner 2049) (400CP)
        Replicants aren't exactly made from clay. The biological materials that go into them take facilities to produce and can get rather expensive to make each and every one individually. You won't have that supply issue however as you've got a seemingly endless supply of the raw biological materials needed to make a Replicant. Or a human. Not too different in the end, you know? You'll receive enough to make at least a dozen Replicants each day and it'll always refill the next day over.


-Supply Cache (Batman Beyond) (400CP)
        Each purchase of this will grant you 1 of two large stores of replenishing resources that can be used for a wide variety of projects. The first cache contains a large amount of mechanical and electronic parts that can be used build or repair a wide array of weapons, gadgets, equipment, and cybernetics similar to what Batman and his enemies use. The second cache is filled with an incredible amount of chemicals, compounds and other substances that can be used to create things like biological mutagens, steroids, drugs, and deadly toxins.
* Is this 800CP or already includes both buys?
* Cost is for a single one. Buying both cost 800 CP.


-Atlesian Contacts (In the Kingdoms Service) (600CP)
        An established group that will approach you if you are ever looking to start up a large enterprise. They will offer advanced technology, very low-interest loans, expertise, and their own services to help you get your enterprise up off the ground, and will support you until you are fully capable of standing on your own two feet (so long as you are also putting in effort). Even beyond this, they will be a friendly competitor so long as you remain on at least neutral terms. The level of help they will offer will adjust based on the setting, but it will always be at least enough to turn a group of (skilled and informed) teenagers into a major intelligence agency.


-Black Market (Ben 10 0.1) (600CP)
        What, did you think it was all about cars? It's great as a hobby but you've got to make some money. To do that, you've got some connections. Whether it's some secure communication channels or meeting places, you've got your fingers in the criminal underworld of the universe. If you need to buy or sell something off the table these are the guys you want to call. If there's some kind of commercially available weapon, gadget, or vehicle of dubious legality you need to get and have its IDs removed, they can do it for pretty reasonable prices. They're not so good at finding super rare or unique items, but just about everything else is fair game. Just as well, if you need something to disappear or be sold, they'll take it off your hands and you will never see it again for a pretty substantial amount of cash. Pretty weirdly loyal for criminal underworld types too...as long as you don't sell them out or give them trouble, they'll be happy to do business with you wherever, whenever.


-Box of Resources (Mass Effect Andromeda) (600CP)
        Have a box full of the Heleus cluster's resources! Great for all your crafting needs, and ensures that you can always use your Andromeda gear. Omni-gel canisters, eezo, angaran meditation crystals, kett alloys, remnant polymers, eiroch fluid sacs, remnant cores, renderable plates, scale fibers, shell filaments, soft chitin.
        You will have to find your own source of the non-exclusive minerals though. This box is as big as the shipping container for the Nomad, is equally divided amongst the 11 resources, and will refill itself once a week. Post Jump, instead of a single shipping container divided amongst the resources, you get a shipping container of each resource, and they all refill monthly. In addition, anytime you run into a universe specific material that you regularly use for crafting, another shipping container will be added. You must have used that material for crafting purposes several times before it would count.


-Cold Fusion Reactor (Touhou Forbidden Hermit) (600CP)
You have a cold fusion reactor. It contains an obscure and fantastical palladium alloy which allows it to fuse hydrogen atoms without creating ionizing radiation somehow, creating fairly low-temperature steam which can easily power a turbine. The reactor is so safe you could even make hot pot in it without hurting anyone, though you will probably have a hard time convincing anyone to eat your food made in a nuclear reactor.


-Recycler And Fabricator | Operator Dispenser (Prey) (700CP)
        Recycler And Fabricator (400CP)
        Perhaps one of the most innovative technologies TranStar has developed after Neuromods. Recyclers breakdown material into its constituent components, by default these are "Organic", "Mineral", "Synthetic" and "Exotic", to be used in the fabricator. Providing that you have a compatible schematic small enough to fit inside the fabricator and the correct materials, the fabricator can craft complex items such as Q-Beams, turrets and Neuromods.
        Operator Dispenser (300CP)
        An unlocked robot fabricator which can create one of 4 different types of "operators". Medical Operators heal the injured, Engineering Operators repair systems like your suit, Science Operators replenish your Psi and Military "Black Box" Operators come equipped with offensive lasers. Comes with 3 charges and will need 3 units of Synthetic, Mineral and Organic material to create a new charge.


-Chronos Supply (Katana Zero) (2200CP)
        This is a case of 10 Chronos syringes, there is nothing special about the syringes or the Chronos contained within (aside from the usual), and the case replenishes at the end of every week. However, if you want to pay a little extra, you can get a shipping container, containing about 1000 doses, that replenish each week, and the formula to make Chronos. The third and final option nets you the same as the second option, but without the side effects, this nets you a shipping container full of side effect less Chronos and the recipe to make more. Taking this improved version of Chronos will purge a person of their addiction, and can reverse some symptoms of withdrawal.




 --- Domain: Supplies: Magical Large Scale (12) (22 Perks) --- 




-Mundane Supply World (The Celestial Foundry) (100CP)
        This item gives you access to all the materials that one could get on Earth, but with one caveat, you'll have to find and harvest them yourself. Your warehouse gains a portal that is linked to an artificial plane of existence that is of infinite size in all directions, where humanity or sapience of any kind never developed. You can find an unlimited number of any resources given enough time, but they are spread around as would naturally occur in nature, meaning you have to often move when you exhaust the local supply. Resources are always located in environments where you would find them on Earth, and when you travel to this world, you are able to choose which environment you arrive in, or return to any prior location you have been before. Environments have realistic distances between them, so if you need something found in several biodomes you need to return to your warehouse, or use a fast transport of some kind.
        Every time you gain a perk that requires access to a new raw material, this raw material appears in the most native form in this supply world and has to be collected as it normally would be. If your material is only found inside stars, you better be ready to get a rocket to go collect it somehow.


-Cidhna Mine (Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB) (200CP)
        Nobody escapes Cidhna Mine, that's how the saying goes anyways. Cidhna mine is an extensive set of tunnels snaking into Nirn which the Silver-Blood Family uses as a prison and as a source of much wealth. Yours isn't that same dreaded mine, though it's similar in many ways. Placed in a reasonable location of your choosing is a copy of the mine, while the original was predominately used for silver mining yours is much greater. Throughout the mines are extensive reserves of just about all of the ores found in Skyrim at the time, ranging from Ebony to Stalhrim and will produce an incredible amount. These reserves will replenish themselves once they begin to run dry and the mine will be manned by NPC guards and workers, though you could always appoint your own workers and guards if you wished. In future jumps it updates to include new material in the mine.
        * Gives unique skyrim materials


-Guild Linked World Item (Overlord (The Series) Guild Base Supplement) (200CP)
        The Great Tomb of Nazarick contains the Throne of Kings, a World Item (and the throne in the throne room) that protects the entirety of the guild base against all attempts at scrying or anti-scrying attacks, and that further generates a small amount of Yggdrasil gold coins any time someone within would be subjected to such, alongside several other effects. Your guild base also possesses a World Item of similar potency integrated into it, and you may purchase this option multiple times.
        Maybe you possess the Rainbow Bridge, which forbids all hostile forms of spatial manipulation within the guild base, while simultaneously providing unparalleled mobility to your own forces that pass through it, allowing them to quickly appear across any distance and even breach dimensional borders, and allowing them to quickly return once finished with whatever task they were set.
        Perhaps instead your guild base contains within it the Garden of Eden, a place said to contain at least a single copy of every plant (or plant like thing) in the entire world, and often many many times more than that for more common things, regrowing within a day anything that is taken. To say nothing of the mighty plant-based creatures that spawn from it that will help to defend your guild base, or how you could harvest from it constantly to feed an immense population.
        Or perhaps instead your guild base possesses an entrance to the legendary Agartha, a subterranean city long abandoned but filled with such mineral wealth that it could be mined forever, with an ore vein for every type of metal or precious stone one could imagine no matter how rare that replenish a mere day after excavation.
        If those don't tickle your interest, perhaps you will find the Scholomance to be to your liking? A school of dark and forbidden magic, filled with the knowledge of every spell imaginable, and that allows unparalleled control and manipulation of the weather and empowers the magic of all rightful inhabitants of the Guild Base while they are inside.
        Or maybe none of these things appeal, and you have a different idea in mind? So long as it is not one of The Twenty (ie: expendable 1-time effects), and so long as it remains entirely tied to the Guild Base itself, you may instead come up with your own World Item, with appropriate effects to apply to your base. In such cases, fanwank as appropriate.


-Holy Stone (Everyone Else is a Returnee) (200CP)
        This is stone infused with large quantities of holy energy, meaning it is extremely full of mana as well as incredibly durable. It is in this way that the holy stone can then be used in any number of ways. Due to the holy properties, it is particularly good for use in the equipment of priests or paladins. Similarly, due to its natural strength it is good for the construction of buildings and structures. You receive several tons of high tier holy stone, enough to make a small house. Any used stone is refilled each month.


-Field of Heart-Shaped Herbs (Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 2) (300CP)
        Out of all the Wakandan secrets that lie within the borders of the reclusive city, this one is the most potent secret of them all. It is also the most dangerous. It is a small but potent field, its soil infused with radiation from the ancient Vibranium meteor when it fell to such an extent that it would affect any plant life growing within it, like these herbs. The herbs are taken and ground up so that it may be imbibed, and when the imbiber is buried under a light covering they will find themselves on a spiritual journey to talk with their ancestors... and then rise a greater warrior. Strength and speed that reaches the lower levels of superhuman, durability to survive explosions with minor injuries. Perfect coordination and balance with agility that far outstrips Olympic athletes. It would not be too farfetched to say that the results of this herb match even the ones derived from the Super Soldier formula that made Captain America... and now you have a small field of these plants. Be very careful. After you leave, this can either be a property or a Warehouse Attachment.


-Dust (The Games We Play) (400CP)
        Ah yes. Where would we be without this? This is a supply of Dust of all types, presented to you weekly for whatever purposes you may have for it.
        Dust being a crystallised form of elemental energy, color changing depending on what it's elemental affinity is. It can be used for a variety of things, be it adding some Aura to make them explode into a burst of their native energy or sewing it into clothing to make empowered wear, putting it in bullets to create specialty ammunition of great strength or just to power technology. Types seen thus far are water, air, lightning, fire, gravity, time and Light, but there are many other kinds.
        For 100 CP it's a fairly small supply. More than enough for a family, even the most wasteful or extravagant one or businessmen or Hunters or any other. Let's say several kilograms of each type.
        For 200 CP it's a larger supply, many tons upon tons of it, enough to keep a small city functioning pretty easily, or keep a small army supplied. Emphasis on the 'small', mind you.
        Of course, you could pay 400CP instead and forget all these constraints. You now own a whole deposit of dust, one with nigh-endless supplies of all types. But of course, once again, the keyword is 'nigh'. Or you could have a set of literally bottomless containers, but where's the fun in that?


-Gold Market (World Seed) (400CP)
        Welcome to the Gold Market! As this is your first time as a customer, let me take this moment to explain. By going to any temple or altar to the Gods, offering one gold coin, and praying for the market to appear, anyone can gain access to it. Though in your case, you'll simply need to think about it for the market to appear in its entirety in your mind, and can browse it at your leisure without having to pay any fees.
        From there, you can buy anything, as long as you can pay the price, though the price is inflated just a tad, such as Seeds of Water normally costing 1 silver going for 20 instead, and something incredibly rare like a Seed of Time costing half a million gold. Incredibly powerful items made by the Gods and normally only accessible through completing quests might even be priced at billions of gold. But this cost is worth it, as there really is literally anything available: items, hints on how to advance your abilities, skills and abilities themselves in their entirety, NPCs (artificial entities created by the system) of any level, whether you want to lease them or buy them outright, information, or animals and monsters. Even things of questionable usefulness can be found here, such as the sex tapes of the Gods ("Goddess of Breasts VS. Goddess of Beauty, Beach Edition, Interactive"), or the abilities to always sense the time of the day and to guess how many hairs there are on a creature. And if you had, say, a decillion gold and sacrificed the population of a planet, you could even buy yourself into Godhood.
        The wares available in the Gold Market will include ones from both worlds you have visited in the past, and worlds you will travel to in the future, so that its slogan of offering truly anything actually holds true for you, though the same price markup still applies. It'll also accept any currency you might have on you, instead of only recognizing the gold coins used in the system. And since you're a VIP, you can even sell things to the market, though you'll only get their normal prices for them instead of the marked up ones.


-Greenhouse Three (Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) (400CP)
        Or any other number you like, really. This greenhouse, either inserted into new worlds in a location of your choosing or attached to your Warehouse, is perfect for growing all manner of magical plants. So perfect, in fact, that it can grow new ones! In addition to several rows of plots and potted plants of all kinds, it contains four larger plots; one at each corner, suitable for one large tree apiece. Planting any kind of magical raw material, such as Re'em blood or unicorn hair, makes a tree that grows that material. Liquid materials are stored in hard, coconut-like fruits on the tree, easily broken with concerted effort but highly unlikely to spill, split, or otherwise damage the surrounding plant life no matter how volatile your reagent is. Since it's a magically expanded greenhouse with literally every species of plant life in it, it also has a bit of magic so that all you need to do is think of what you need and start walking down a row, and you'll reach it within seven paces. All plants within this greenhouse are automatically cared for and reach maturity within a maximum of one week. Plants are kept docile by the greenhouse's magic, so don't worry about the Venomous Tentacula eating one of your ears while you're not looking. Doesn't automatically update in future jumps, but you can bring new plants into it manually and incorporate them into the greenhouse by planting them in the provided pots. A must-have for aspiring Potions masters.


-Herb Garden (Azeroth) (400CP)
        A herb garden designed however you wish. At the basic level this garden has all the herbs found on Earth and in Classic WoW. Herbs picked here will not need to be replanted and will regrow on their own without any help from you. There will always be enough herbs for whatever you may need them for, but if you pick more than 100 herbs within a month they will need time to rest before they regrow taking one month to do so. You can attach this to your warehouse, a pocket dimension, or import it into the world of Future Jumps.
        * If you really want to you can keep the increasing CP cost by 50 CP for every WOW expansion.


-Metal of the Gods (The Death Mage Who Doesn't Want A Fourth Time) (400CP)
        Adamantite. Mythril. Orichalcum. Magical metals of incredible power. Adamantite and Mythril are opposites, in a way. The first, incredibly sturdy, the perfect material to defend against the physical world. Mythril, on the other had, has anti-magic effects, defending against spells just as well as Adamantite does against physical blows, while also being capable of damaging spirits. Finally, there is Orichalcum, the metal of the Gods, having resistance against both physical and magical blows even greater than the other two. The metals of Gods, which are now at your hands. You have a replenishing supply of each material, enough to forge from their raw forms an entire suit of plate armor, a shield, a spear, and a sword. This supply, should it be used or sold, will replenish once every year, though it should be noted that those with the ability to forge from these great metals is far and few between. Post jump, you will also receive an equal supply of any other metals considered divine alongside the ones provided here from any setting's visited, including those created by you or others.


-Qian Yuan's Treasure Vault (Talisman Emperor-Mortal Dimension) (400CP)
        Chen Xi encountered a treasure vault much like this one in the Oceanic Desert. While he had to fight several cultivators to get away with the treasure, you'll have an easier time, as this vault attaches to your Warehouse or inserts into jumps in a location only known to you (you may make this choice for each jump). The Vault contains 4,096 doors, and behind each door is a space containing a particular item: medicinal pills suitable to aid in cultivation or to recharge Essence during battle, piles of rare materials like White Refined Gold, Water Netherstone, Six-Yang Crimson Iron, Azure Heart Wood, suitable for equipment refinement and alchemy, gardens filled with varieties of spirit herbs and flowers in effect, if it's a material used to craft something, it can probably be found here. The materials slowly replenish themselves so long as they aren't completely used up (and there is no material which is singular - you cannot completely use up a material unless you are in a hurry to craft something big), and you can add materials from future jumps to the vault to have them gain the same benefit.


-Quintessence Fountain (Exalted - The Sidereals) (400CP)
        This large jade fountain will be installed in your warehouse. Every time someone offers a prayer with no other place to go, one that there is no other spirit who will hear, it will be drawn to the fountain and become a droplet of the shining liquid called Quintessence. When someone prays to you or one of your companions, it will instead merge together with other such prayers to eventually form a rainbow colored block of Ambrosia that floats in the fountain. A quick prayer to the fountain will summon craftsgods to fashion whatever mundane material or object you wish from these substances. Things made from Quintessence will be wondrous but temporary, food that will disappear if not eaten or clothes that will fade to nothing after a month. Objects made from Ambrosia will be permanent and can include Jade or, unlike regular Ambrosia, Starmetal. Another fountain (or even several, if the property is big enough) will appear on each other area that you take with you between worlds.


-The Mine (Azeroth) (400CP)
        As the name suggests, this is a mine. At a basic level, which you get with the first purchase, you get basic metals of which you can find on Earth and Classic WoW. You will gain all ores of that expansion and all previous ones. Your mine will grow in size adding additional floors representing the different expansions for each purchase of this item. The mine will never run dry, but it can be depleted if you gather the ore too quickly. Give the mine a month and it'll be back up to full capacity. You can place this mine anywhere in future Jumps that you wish or within your own pocket dimension, if you have one.
        * If you really want to you can keep the increasing CP cost by 50 CP for every WOW expansion.


-Alchemical Haven (Desolate Era Part I - The Three Realms) (600CP)
        This is a plot of land about three hundred and fifty thousand square miles large that would keep getting bigger to accommodate additional plants, accessible through a door in your warehouse. Inside this dimension, you will find soil that adapts itself to grow whatever is planted in it, and an atmosphere that will change itself to meet the demands of each and every plant as needed, transforming some areas into barren, frozen wastelands, and others into fiery hellholes. To add to this, the Alchemical Haven automatically harvests fruits and replants seeds, meaning that the only intervention needed for it to stay operational is the introduction of new seeds. It can even speed up time for some plants so that they can be planted and harvested as much as you wish. However, this only works when there are no sentient beings within the dimension. Before you plant anything, there are several mortal ranked fruits and spiritual grasses already planted and matured for you to use that altogether may allow you to enter the Zifu stage, if you already possess the required insights.
        * This items time acceleration component is unique among plant growth garden items
-Heavenly Azure Profound Jungle (Against the Gods!) (600CP)
        Pills, pellets and crystals are a cornerstone of cultivation. Even one or two powerful pills can redefine the fates of entire clans or sects, as it so happens. Equally important, however, are Profound Beasts, or rather their bodies. There is the blood, which is a great tool in cultivation, the flesh and bones, used for their own purposes, but the most special are the Profound Cores found within these beasts that make life in so many parts of these worlds so difficult.
        You have something completely amazing, in that regard. This is a dense jungle, attached to your warehouse, filled with all sorts of dangerous profound beasts. As a matter of fact, it has one of every single species and race of Profound Beasts in this setting, all ready and waiting for you. Because you see, while the blood, flesh, bones, core and everything of these beasts is at the level they're supposed to be, their actual fighting abilities are dramatically lower. Three entire realms lower, as a matter of fact. That is, the Emperor level monsters can only do damage on the level of a True Realm monster, and so on. Unless you want them at full power for some reason, that is, Then they are.
        This doesn't apply to beasts below the Sky Profound Realm, so the weakest any of them get is to Elementary. Also, each Realm monsters are isolated in their own 'zone' of the Jungle they practically never leave, with the weakest ones on the outermost circle and so on. The numbers of the beasts inside are proportional to how rare they are in the outside world, as is the rate of replenishment if killed. Even the rarest beasts only take a few months, though, maybe a full year for the absolute rarest of them.
        In future worlds, the Jungle provides beasts from the local setting too.


-Let there be Light (The Games We Play) (600CP)
        And so there is. This is a replenishing supply of neutral Sephirot components of all ten kinds, for all your soul crafting needs without the horribly unethical gathering process and terrible guilt.
        You get 1000 people's worth of pure, high quality Sephirot, the stuff souls are made of. It's so high quality that each is worth a hundred of your average souls, if not more. Don't worry about losing any unused stuff either, because it builds up as time goes on. Sephirot is some of the most valuable stuff in the world here, and that's for a reason.
        In this world, the ratio of Sephirot within your soul determines its structure, the power of your Semblance and other such things. In future worlds, it could be entirely different, luckily enough you get the local stuff no matter where you go, allowing you to keep up your tinkering. And again, don't worry about losing access to any of the past stuff. Each setting's soul stuff will continue to produce itself separately from a separate setting.
        But what use does it have in the future? Depends on where you go and how it all works there, but you'll have to figure that yourself for the most part. Maybe you can eat it.


-Mineral caverns (Trinity:Aberrant) (600CP)
        A sprawling network of natural caverns that you have expanded on, these tunnels are surprisingly cozy. There's about as much space in the caverns as a large shopping mall, and you can rearrange things to your liking. You'll also need to install amenities yourself, the caverns begin with nothing but bare stone walls. Changes you make inside are retained, and you can choose to have appropriate properties attached to the caverns at the beginning of each jump. The main appeal of these caverns is that unusual mineral formations occlude any energy emissions, from inside or outside. Sensors, super-senses, magic and 'other' will register the caverns as an area of undisturbed rock, no matter who or what is inside.


-Mithril Mines and Armory (Lord of the Rings - Twilight of the North) (600CP)
        There may be older and fouler things than Orcs in the deep places of the world, but there are great treasures and opportunities to be found in those places as well. Dwarven miners know this, and the lure of mithril often proves irresistible. With this, you need not worry about the presence of any Balrog or Orcs, as your veins of mithril shall lie within a mine dropped into a location near to where you start or even just connected to your Warehouse. The great quantities of mithril that these mines make available allow Dwarf-smiths, should you have invited any, to craft marvellously strong and light armor for your warriors or yourself. More than simply a store-room and workshop for Dwarven smiths, a Mithril Armory is capable of outfitting an entire host in the most supple and strong metal known in Middle-earth. The presence of such materials naturally attracts the finest Dwarvensmiths, who may also turn their efforts to forging superior weapons in addition to crafting mithril armor. Armored and armed in shining mithril and dwarf-make weapons, your forces are certain to be fearsome indeed on the battlefield. In future jumps, you will attract whatever setting equivalent to the Dwarves there happens to be. To find work in your armory and lands.


-Natural Regeneration (World Seed) (600CP)
        In Neolife, it wouldn't be wrong to say that magic is in everything. One interesting facet of this can be seen in how on many worlds, dug earth and other natural resources are replaced by the ambient mana over the course of a few weeks if there isn't anything like a support structure preventing it. While this is certainly convenient, you thought to yourself, I can do better. After all, many important resources can't even be found on planets, like mana gems or the insanely rare mineral osmium, which are only found on asteroids. But with the ability you created, this won't be a problem anymore, because you can just restore them anyway: simply by spending enough mana, it is possible for you to regenerate any natural resource or duplicate existing ones.
        You could pump mana into an asteroid to restore whatever it is that was mined there to get effectively infinite resources out of it, do the same to the extremely valuable gem lying in front of you to get multiple copies of it, or send out a massive wave of mana to cover a whole planet in a forest. The mana required scales linearly with the amount of the resource you want to work with, its complexity, and its power. So while you could easily get massive amounts of diamonds and wood even with a little mana, duplicating something like the Top 5 metals (see Notes) or similar materials would require truly insane amounts of mana.


-Starstuff (Peter Pan) (600CP)
A refilling bag of the mythical, green powder that can be produced from stars under rare occasion. It has a variety of magical properties depending on who is exposed. Any animal exposed to the substance transforms into a mythical, humanoid creature similar to its origin; for instance, a fish may become a mermaid, or a bird may become a fairy, though not the normal kinds found in Neverland. Furthermore, humans exposed to it can fly and can gain artistic inspiration; however, overexposure can lead to greed and paranoia. Outside of this purchase, the substance is extremely difficult to find in the traditional Peter Pan, unless the setting was changed. Also, unlike its form in the story, the Starstuff cannot be used to destabilize the fabric of the universe.


-Supreme Emerald Spirit Garden (Against the Gods!) (600CP)
        This is a garden worthy of being in legends, Jumper. A vast expanse of earth richly covered with grass, located in either an attachment to your warehouse, one of your other pocket dimensions or on a real world spot of your choice, this has exactly as much space as needed for its purposes. Which are twofold.
        Firstly, it has prime, finest-quality samples of every single herb, flower etc in existence. It doesn't matter how rare or valuable they are, you can find at least one of every one, and potentially many more. Plants breed and spread at rates proportional to their rarity and rates of breeding in the outside world. Something like the Emperor Awakening Heart Lotus, a plant normally found once in centuries or millennia, takes a full year to bloom, and others take proportionately lesser time.
        In future jumps the garden won't acquire any plants that are absolutely unique, like Yggdrasil in Norse Myth, but everything else is fair game, even divine or mythical plants of all types. And as for those plants, you need to find a seed and sow them here, at which point they become as any other plants.
        Additionally, this garden has the property of 'adapting' any plants seeded here to the local settings. That is, a fruit that provides ki or magical energy in its original world would provide Profound Energy in this one, and the equivalent in future settings. They retain the ability to provide any previous 'versions' at your will.


-Tenebrium Basics | Tenebrium Mine (Divinity - Original Sin) (800CP)
Tenebrium Basics (200CP)
        Tenebrium is an odd mineral. It grows like a crystal, but can be melted and forged like iron. It is easily enchanted, but highly resistant to other kinds of magic. In addition, it is highly dangerous and inflicts a disease known simply as Rot upon all those who handle it in any form. Worst of all, Rot cannot be cured by simple magical spells, requiring rare and powerful artifacts to cleanse the infected. Most cannot afford such things and slowly wither over the months following handling a single chunk of crystal. But with this perk, you have come to understand how to safely handle Tenebrium without infecting yourself.
Tenebrium Mine (600CP)
        Tenebrium is an utterly useful material, for all that it is also incredibly dangerous to handle. Still, considering all its uses, one can hardly be blamed for desiring to have a steady supply of the crystal on hand. The Tenebrium Mine attaches directly to your Cosmic Warehouse and takes the form of a traditional mining tunnel about a hundred feet deep. Inside one will find a few dozen crystals of Tenebrium growing, each large enough to produce a single ingot when smelted. Once harvested new crystals will slowly grow in their place over the course of a week. The mine is also capable of producing other metals, crystals, and even gemstones if given a sample of such material. These will form in veins along the walls of the tunnel, but grow much more slowly. Exotic metals will form at a rate of one ingot every two weeks and crystals will produce roughly the same amount. Gemstones seem to be easier and the mine will produce a collection of small stones that will fill a cupped hand in a week. Normal metals, like gold and silver, can also be produced at a rate of one ingot per week. An ingot here refers to enough material to forge a traditional longsword with.




 --- Domain: Databases: Mundane (13) (59 Perks) --- 




-Ceph Technology Tree (Crysis) (100CP)
        Within this small vial is a delicate sample of a Ceph commander unit, once active but now 'dead'. The nanomachinery is still active at some level, but it acts without intelligence nor connection to the Ceph hivemind, making it relatively safe to handle. It's not exactly a gold mine of every possible Ceph technology, but studying it can yield tremendous advances.


-0-D for Dummies (Megas XLR) (200CP)
        A set of textbooks that explains the basics of Hyper-dimensional structure, most potent in making spaces with overlapping existences in layman terms, use tech in making spaces and parts that don't exist in real space. Warning! Extremely energy intensive.


-Ancient Knowledge Database (Stargate Atlantis) (200CP)
        Not interested in buying a Lantean City Ship or infiltrating Atlantis itself to get your hands on all that wonderful science? This small server farm (the size of an olympic swimming pool) will be placed in your Cosmic Warehouse or other property of your choice with the appropriate power and network hookups. Don't expect to start churning out ZPMs just by buying this; first you'll have to sift through what is basically the Ancient scientific equivalent of our Internet - only instead of being a few mere decades worth of information produced by a people who've barely gotten off their first rock, this database holds tens of thousands of years of information collected by an entire intergalactic civilisation.


-CRAFT Mind Files (Limitless) (200CP)
        You have copies of mind files from all the leading minds of CRAFT, complete with uncanny valley-esque holographic heads, informationally replicating their knowledge. These can never be stolen or corrupted, and each jump you can receive additional mind files and holographic heads for the premier scientists of the jump. Just keep in mind that the software running them does a middling poor job of replicating personalities.


-Extremis Formula (Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1) (200CP)
        Another attempt at creating super soldiers, this formula creates a virus that can enhance a person to superhuman strength, reflexes, and endurance. Additionally, normal Extremis users gain the ability to generate extreme amounts of heat through a complex metabolic process, generating heat from their bodies up to several thousand degrees Celsius on any part of the body they desire. When regenerating body parts, the wounds take on the appearance of burning ashes while growing back the lost body part, in a matter of minutes, and cooling into regular skin, flesh, and bone. Be wary however, as this makes you light up on thermal sensors, and should your body heat up too much, you may end up exploding. Keep this in mind.


-N-Ways Fusion Plant (Endless Space) (200CP)
        Refueling? What's that? You have mastered the art of Endless power generation, and any device you possess or can claim as yours never runs out of power. Other things can still be a problem, like weapons overheating, engines breaking down, etc, but you never need to worry about your battery running out. Your starting equipment and ship already have fusion plants installed in them, and you have schematics to make more, of various sizes, but you will need some rare elements and facilities to make them. The smaller they are, the simpler it is. Making a capital ship reactor is going to take a LOT of materials, but is totally worth it.


-Primordial Schematics (Necron Jump SB Edition 1.0) (200CP)
        The human world of Cadia was able to stymie the advance of Chaos largely due to the efforts of Necron technology. The mysterious pylons of Cadia acted to reinforce the materium even on the verge of the Eye of Terror. During the Thirteenth Black Crusade, the Archmagos Belisarius Cawl was even able to use them to shrink the largest Warp Storm in the galaxy. The designs behind this priceless technology are now within your possession. Outside of this setting, pylons designed according to the specifications of these schematics will disrupt interdimensional portals and incursions with some fine-tuning.


-Strange Formula | Nitrimine (Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1) (200CP)
        Strange Formula (100CP)
        This chemical formula is the brainchild of the German scientist Dr. Erskine, and is directly responsible for the creation of Captain America. As is, this is only the formula, and you must make it yourself... but as a result it could possibly let you modify the serum for other uses. Beware its tendencies to amplify the personality traits of the user, or be prepared to find a way to fix that fact.
        Nitrimine (Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1) (100CP)
        The formula for the chemical compound known as Nitramene, this compound has multiple purposes. A typical Nitramene bomb has a blast radius of five hundred yards after which it creates a vacuum that causes an implosion as matter rushes to fill the void that it has created, but a grenade of that size will do considerably less damage. On the other hand, Nitramene also emits low levels of Vita Radiation, which has a specific wavelength that has stabilizing properties.


-Technical Schematics (Warhammer 40k - T'au empire) (200CP)
        This small database is a well organized, easily searchable, and easily accessible list of detailed schematics and scientific texts covering all machines, tools, and sciences understood by the T'au. It cannot be remotely hacked or externally corrupted by others. During your jump, this database includes all T'au knowledge up to either current 40k canon or all information that would be available to the T'au within the next hundred years without your interference, whichever option includes less advanced technology. After this jump, the schematics are upgraded to include all designs and science your T'au have developed and all designs and science developed in canon by the T'au by the end of the Fifth Sphere Expansion.


-Vitrium notes (Trinity: Aberrant) (200CP)
        A synthetic crystal that can be spun and blown like glass while being mechanically as strong as steel at a quarter of the weight, colored or transparent as desired. But every object made of Vitrium has a unique resonant frequency that if hit at sufficient intensity will cause it to shatter like a crystal wine glass. Perhaps these notes discarded by Vitrium's creator can help you perfect the material?


-RobCo Holotapes (Fallout 4) (300CP)
        A series of Holotapes detailing the blueprints for numerous Robco projects, including Protectrons, Assaultrons, Securitrons, and the various models of Pip-Boys. There's even a group of Holotapes detailing Liberty Prime's systems and construction. These Holotapes seem to be more advanced than the standard kind, and therefore there are only a few rather than the hundreds this amount of information would normally take up.


-The Codex (Uber) (300CP)
        The entirety of the mysterious work of unknown origin that enabled Project U in the first place. To this date only a minor portion has been deciphered. The first chapter does provide instructions to decoding the rest based on universal mathematical principles. After that it consists of three main sections. The first contains instructions to produce the catalyst, the second describes a possible way to locate people susceptible to the upgrade process and has as of yet been untranslated, the third details the separate ways of upgrading humans. Even with the instructions provided the confusing manner passages are structured, combined with the interwoven philosophical treatises and the fact that there seem to be thousands of ways to decode the passages to slightly different results it will take months to decipher a single passage of a relevant length. This item does not come with the already translated passages.


-Animate Library (MtG - Bablovia) (400CP)
        A living library containing all sorts of Bablovian wisdom and science. The library is a loyal servant which obeys your every command. It gets stronger with every book in it, but will never get stronger than you are. The spirit animating the library can be transported to any library or collection of books you own.


-Antibody Creation (Cells at Work) (400CP)
        Preparation is the key to victory, and now, you can prepare a solution to any enemy you face. A solution in the chemical sense, anyway. You now know how to synthesize a special liquid that can be attuned to a specific enemy, acting like an acid on them when they are exposed to it. You can modulate how potent of an effect it has, from dissolving away at them, to merely giving burns, to even just targeting their clothes and equipment. This liquid does take some time to make, generally around half an hour to an hour, but it can go much quicker if you have access to some DNA or other similar chemical identifiers. With time and experimentation, you may find out how to have other effects aside from just acid, such as knocking them unconscious or sealing away their abilities for a time.
        Premade Solutions (w/ Lucky Defender): You now have the ability to create special 'blank' solutions, which are apparently unattuned to any given enemy. However, when you carry these 'blank' solutions with you, and you get drawn in to face a surprise enemy, you'll find that they are attuned specially to that enemy. You'll have to make more 'blank' solutions afterward, as all prior made 'blank' solutions would have been attuned specifically to that surprise enemy.


-Archive (Artemis Fowl) (400CP)
        Whoa, access to the Council's black archives! Well, not exactly, but close. This is a digital archive in your possession, and what it holds is technology. That is, all of it. Every single piece of technology, from the wheel onwards to the most advanced stuff under the earth, has it's schematics, developer's notes and blueprints stored here, explained clearly and obviously enough that simply following the instructions would let someone build it all up.
        There is everything here, from the People's works to Humanity's designs. Every program ever written, every microchip ever designed, the whole sum total of human and fairy technical knowledge. In future worlds too, it updates to hold the same level of detail on the local technology, everything ever crafted in the world.


-Archives (Doctor Who) (400CP)
        Man, if word of this got out... anyway, this is a small technological database holding some... knowledge. Massive, impossible amounts of knowledge, all stored in a tiny little thing like this... Okay, so the way this works is, for 200 CP, you can get the whole techbase of one of the 'less' advanced species. Sontarans, Silurians, and their like. This would be a complete database, with complete and full information on every piece of technology they have. Cloning, spaceships, hibernation, the works.
        The 400 CP version lets you get tech from the more advanced species, instead, like 'future humanity' with Time Travel and Galaxy Cracker bombs, or data on similar levels from other species like the Time Lords or so.


-Biotransference Protocols (Necron Jump SB Edition 1.0) (400CP)
        Behold, the designs that were meant to secure the salvation of the Necrontyr, and instead cost them their souls. These schematics contain two things of note: the first is the Necrodermis shells of the Necrons and their constructs, from the lowliest Warriors and Scarabs to the greatest Tomb Sentinels. Secondly, they teach the method of biotransference itself, transitioning an organic mind into a body of metal. Will you use these designs to create a robotic army to put the Men of Iron to shame? Or will you use them to secure immortality?


-Capsule Calamity (Dragon Ball) (400CP)
        This is a patented prize of the Capsule Corporation, able to store incredibly large and unwieldy objects in light, easy-to-use capsules. You now know how to make such capsules and store things up to the size of a small house in a single one. You can even 're-equip' things to said capsules once you're done using them. How handy is that?


-Computation Technologies (Generic Cyberpunk) (400CP)
        An Artificial intelligence isn't constrained by the need for food or water, but by the need for power and processors. You have in your possession the designs and documentation for computing technologies that are the peak of what a world like this can offer. Easily scale-able to whatever your needs or desires are, produced for either general or specialized uses, these are easily adapted to handle whatever you require and will remain applicable and top of the line for decades to the envy of others who might want technology like this. Why be limited to what the market can provide for you when you can have the best.


-Factorio Database (Factorio) (400CP)
        A bulky data storage device containing the blueprints and software needed to construct and run all of Factorio's machines, weapons, buildings, and vehicles.


-Full Storage (Modded Fallout) (400CP)
        This old, half-broken Pip-Boy seems to be incapable of even starting its operating system, the diagnostics indicating that the entirety of its vast 64k RAM is already in use. Most people might simply discard it or strip it for spare parts, but a closer look will reveal the exact reason for its fault: its internal database has been crammed full of Fallout design specs, schematics, scientific principles and so on. How full, you ask? Well, it's got just about every semi-common piece of Fallout tech in there somewhere, from Laser Rifle schematics to Assaultron software and Berry Mentat formulations to Power Armor designs. Though mainly limited to the kind of technologies one could have found in the Pre-War world of old, a number of designs that were only finalized in the two centuries following the apocalypse can also be found here (such as the Hydra drug, the Enclave's X-01 and Hellfire armor designs, and the Radium Rifle). Though you'll still need a way to actually build all of these things, this database is nonetheless one of the most spectacular treasures scavvers could find.


-Leonardo da Vinci's Journal (World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression) (400CP)
        An artifact from the time now known as the Renaissance, these works of a man who was part of one of the great movements of humanity’s Mania can be seen evidenced in everything around the modern era, however the most well known by far are those artifacts crafted, drawn, drafted, and painted by one Leonardo da Vinci. He was not the greatest of his age in anything singular but his ideas are the stuff of modern legend and looking at the devices he worked on one could see the raw, unrefined principles he was working with.
        This journal is a work akin to that great man's works which explains all the internally consistent ideas of your Aesthetic, written in a way that the journal contains the element of Leonardo's genius that allowed him to translate his ideas to others so well. By reading this journal anyone, even a Mere Mortal, would treat the Aesthetic in question as if it were normal science, 'getting around' the worst Havok. If you somehow have (Not so) Consistent Technology you instead have a single Journal per Aesthetic you've used, in a trunk that always seems to have enough room inside it for just one more Journal, no matter the number already within, however the person affected by this item must read it through, not memorize it but at least once cover to cover, in order for the benefits to kick.


-Perfect Body (Andromeda) (400CP)
        You are in possession of a fully functioning and programmed to your specifications android body with an appearance to your liking. This is more Sturdy than a standard avatar, it has been built with the best Vedran technology. Built to survive the horrors of the post Commonwealth society, and with blueprints to make more. This body can be upgraded if you know how and keeps upgrades in-between jumps. You can choose for this to be used as a free android companion.


-Professor T.O. Morrow's Notes (Young Justice) (400CP)
        These notes detail the creation of the Red series of androids, including Red Torpedo, Red Inferno, Red Tornado, and Red Volcano, as well as designs for androids that resemble actual people.


-Recipe codex (Unmodded Minecraft) (400CP)
        Summoned to hand or dismissed with a thought, this book records every Minecraft recipe that exists within the game. Post-jump, the book will update with every blueprint, chemical process or recipe you create or learn. Whenever you lay hands on a new type of material, the book will update itself with a detailed analysis of its mechanical properties. While the book only records what you know and cannot create new designs, it can extrapolate from existing knowledge and make suggestions when you need to make modifications or substitutions to existing blueprints.


-Sentinel Plans (X-Men Evolution) (400CP)
        How on earth did you get these? The prototype isn't meant to be finished until almost a year passes. Regardless these are Bolivar Task's plans to even out the mutant playing field with a mass producible robot. The sentinel as it is called is capable of many things ranging from firing lasers, flight to the atmosphere, and has a gel substance which will trap most mutants. It seems like there are even plans for something called a Super Sentinel but with current technology it's almost impossible to complete. Maybe you'll be the first to bring it in then.


-Stark's Blueprints (The Avengers - Earth's Mightiest Heroes) (400CP)
        Perhaps thanks to a bit of corporate espionage, you now have blueprints for pretty much everything that Tony Stark has ever built (with the exception of things built off world or with the help of others, such as the Uru armor or the Magic Nullifier). Includes his suits, his Arc Reactor technology, and the Quinjets.


-The Art and Science (Draka Series) (400CP)
        You now have a complete technical database of every scientific and technological development that has been produced by either the Alliance or the Domination, all the way up to the interstellar era of 'Drakon'. This database will update in future jumps to add in a complete archive of all local technology or magic, up to the latest time period available for the Jumper to insertinton. As a convenience feature, the database has an intuitive search engine that makes finding anything you're looking for a snap.


-The Anything OS (The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya) (400CP)
        This is a 'perfect' operating system for any computer. It's compatible with every form of software that exists, runs faster than anything that'll develop in the next hundred years or so, and has no weak points. In general this system is the greatest piece of software that can exist. Updates anytime there is software greater than it to be in the average top ten percentile of the local software. Never downgrades.


-Training Packets (Satisfactory-factorio Gauntlet) (400CP)
        The form of this depends on the world you're in. It could be a chest full of books, or a briefcase full of manila folders, or a flash drive full of documents. Whatever it is, it contains documents for training anyone in how to use any of your technology or systems. These documents take no more than six hours to read, switch to the best-understood language of whoever is reading them, and give perfect understanding to the reader. They will be able to implement and perform the tasks described in the manuals perfectly. Respawns in a week.


-Wraith Data Device (Stargate Atlantis) (400CP)
        A Wraith data storage device, with an adaptor for human computers. It contains everything you ever wanted to know about Wraith technology but were too afraid to ask. The sheer volume of data deals more with theory rather than engineering practice (eg: you might find the technical explanation on how the Wraith beaming tech works, but not the schematics to build one straight away)


-Engineer's Notes: Avvenire (ARIA) (500CP)
        A last set of documents that was kept in the archives. This copy seems to have been fragmented into components, though as you compile more of it together it will become evident that this details the specifics of the actual terraforming process, including the equipment and calculations involved in the process of creating Aqua. It does go to note that while the knowledge stored within this could help a new engineer tackle a different terraforming project, each planet presents its own challenges, and this information is better taken as a sample of notes rather than a hard guideline.
        Each time you take this option your own abilities at controlling the logistic and engineering elements of terraforming improves slightly, though with ten purchases you'll find that the documents will be complete. Further purchases won't help you much unless you have a different use for them.
        * (The doc seemed to have a nonworking link for the use)
        * Included all 10 buy options in the above price


-The Plecian Tome (Light of Terra) (500CP)
        The Pleician Tome is a portable font of certain archives, templates and pieces of ancient lore, created by a senior Tech-priest of the Adeptus Mechanicus and used by Techmarines. Even to a trained eye, the information is a seemingly random collection, with no easy means of navigation, and so it takes much study to glean anything relevant to a particular task. Indeed, only those with a wide knowledge of Machine Spirits and engine lore have any hope of understanding the information contained within, however, those with patience and the appropriate skills can find secrets of great use within the datacore, secrets dating back to the fabled Dark Age of Technology.


-Adoption Papers (World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression) (600CP)
        This is something that can't be, yet is. Brought to you by a friend to your 'in' at 'some cost' clearing up 'some debt'. A blueprint of a work you've never put together but still it is in your style with no error. A reposed wonder three-hundred years ahead of it's time written out in gross detail through an accompanying journal allows you to fit all the pieces together, all you'll need to do is put it together. The finished product is a simple microchip that houses an AI. The true glory of this invention is the fact that the Ai itself is Inspired and because of its programming always has a decent obligation to humanity. By inserting this technology into any willing mere mortal they will act as if they themselves had been Inspired, though not with the potential for growth that you have, never causing Havoc and even able to create Wonders.


-Aperture Science Technology | Conversion Gel recipe | Repulsion Gel recipe | Propulsion Gel recipe | Unexplained Science Thing (Portal) (600CP)
        Conversion Gel recipe (100CP)
        This is a recipe for Aperture's Conversion Gel, which makes any surface it coats able to conduct a portal. More importantly, it's a huge improvement over Aperture's current bank-braking recipe. Ground up rocks from any object considered a moon will work, mixed with the recipe for especially thick Jello. Washes off with water.
        Repulsion Gel recipe (200CP)
        This is a recipe for Aperture's Repulsion Gel, a blue liquid which repulses anything which touches it. Other names include that bouncy stuff, the blue gel, and unknown skeleton-hating element. Unlike Aperture's current expensive and lengthy recipe, this one involves precisely combining rubber with hydrogen and oxygen. Blue dye is optional. Washes off with water. Why is this recipe so expensive? Repulsion Gel can be used as a potent weapon against anything mobile that relies on solid structural integrity by covering that thing in the Gel. It will repulse any movement back in the other direction, creating a movement which is then repulsed in the other direction by the Gel covering the other size of that thing. One twitch becomes movement in every direction at terminal velocity, tearing that thing apart. This includes the human body.
        Propulsion Gel recipe (100CP)
        This is a recipe.. Okay, you get the picture. The acceleration gel is created by adding seemingly random elements to a modern recipe for no-stick spray. The gel increases the velocity of any object moving on it unless that object is at rest. Washes off with water
        Unexplained Science Thing (200CP)
        You have no idea what this thing does. No idea at all! It could have the effect of any one of Aperture's miscellaneous inventions depending on how you try to use it. Shape the ill-defined mass into the shape of a disk and put it in a computer? You've discovered the annotated source code for Aperture's OS, able to run an AI on the power from a potato battery. Disperse it into an air vent and record the results? You now have the ability to convert type AB blood into pure gasoline with laser technology. There's only enough Unexplained Science Thing for it to be a single one of Aperture's innovations not already listed here. Choose wisely!


-Apollo's Odyssey (Horizon Zero Dawn V0.9a) (600CP)
        Supposedly destroyed by an antimatter explosion in orbit, somehow the Odyssey's copy of Apollo has ended up in your possession. This cache of information contains all the knowledge the Old Ones were able to salvage before the collapse, and attaches to your warehouse, although is accessible through any connected device.


-Bioid Blueprints (Ben 10 0.1) (600CP)
        Oh dear. Vilgax won't be happy to find out someone stole his idea. These are blueprints for mass-producing an army of featureless androids with very basic AI. Their true power comes from the one commanding them, however...once synchronized to a commander (presumably you) they will transform to match you in body and DNA, becoming an army with your own abilities spread among them. Even better, if you have some way to synchronize them to a larger database, they can change into any existing DNA within said database. Considering all you have seen up to this point, you can see why such an army would be fearsome and able to conquer the universe, no? Be warned, if cut off from this network, these Bioids change back to normal and become harmless...so try to protect wherever they're getting it from.


-Bowman's Schematics (Freefall) (600CP)
        Using these plans, you could make learning AIs (though not seed AI) that are guaranteed to never go evil or try to take over. By following the instruction and diagrams even a layperson with only a very basic degree of construction skills, intelligence and the needed materials can make any of the AIs that Dr Bowman made in canon. This can also aid you if you have an understanding of how to create other variations: it can be used not just for Planet Jean-style robots and Bowman's Wolves, but for other creations whether they are completely inorganic, organic, cyborgs, infomorphs, or really any other form you can build. For largely organic creations, Exo-Womb may be a good purchase. The only problem you might have is that they categorically refuse to fight any human. AI created with Bowman's Schematics not only won't harm a human by choice, they can't be hacked to do so. If someone or something successfully controls them, they could perhaps steal the robot’s monetary resources or perhaps damage them directly, but as soon as a human is in danger the hacker/controller will fail. I'm sure an enterprising person could find uses regardless of that.


-Building Better Worlds (Aliens vs Predator) (600CP)
        It seems you've got a lot of proprietary secrets packed away in that skull of yours; Weyland Yutani has its fingers in many pies, after all. All of that proprietary technology is resting at your fingertips: Atmospheric Processing Stations that can turn a barren, unbreathable moon into a world that humans can survive and thrive on. Starship drives that can punch through the speed of light to deliver passengers and cargo from distant worlds in a fraction of the time speed of light transports would take. Androids that are indistinguishable, in appearance and behaviour to humans, yet superior in almost every way. And lastly, genetic experimentation data collected from across inhabited space; enough to get you started should you need to modify a certain newly-discovered breed. All this and more are the tools at your command. Build a better world.


-Dark Science Index (Honkai Impact Third) (600CP)
        This is it, the dark science index in all of its cataloged glory. This has 666 inventions stored inside of its databanks. Many of which are worthless or incredibly situational, but if you take your time to comb through the whole index you can find there may be quite a few gems of absurdity that you just may be able to recreate or improve using this as your guide


-Derelict Ship (DCEU) (600CP)
        An additional ship from Krypton that arrived alongside the one that brought Superman to Earth. This ship has long since been abandoned, perhaps never even having a living pilot, and the systems relating to weaponry and movement have long since been irrevocably destroyed. However, it seems the ship was a science vessel and it retains an in depth database on almost all Kryptonian technology that existed. Weaponry, ships, armour, genetics and more are within the databanks here, governed by a friendly Artificial Intelligence that will assist you in learning all that is stored here.


-Flask Plan Data (Medaka Box Abnormal) (600CP)
        The jewel of Hakoniwa Academy or at least what they hope will one day be that jewel. This USB contains all the data so far accumulated by the Flask Plan and a fair bit more on top. A project created in order to one day turn Normals into Abnormals, these are the starting steps towards successfully completing that plan. Given the creators of the plan's true origins, there'd be no hope of succeeding at all without having this in hand and yet even with it, you're still in for an arduous road of study, experimentation and a lot of expended resources. But when you've managed to bottle the essence of Gods, it'll all be worth it.


-Forbidden Knowledge (Frank Herbert's Dune) (600CP)
        You have access to the complete record of all human technology ever created, from the workings and intricacies of Holtzman Science to the ability to create No Chambers, Thinking Machines, and Artificial Navigators. From now on, wherever you go, you'll gain a download of all scientific and technological knowledge ever developed in that universe by a member of your race... no matter how lost or secret it might be. Richesians are masters of miniaturization, and are able to make machines up to a hundred times smaller than they should be without losing any effectiveness. Ixians are experts in non-digital programming, able to create non-computerized machines capable of replicating almost anything a computer can do besides think for itself.


-Full Coalition Database (Invincible) (600CP)
        You gain a full Coalition of Planets database that adapts to be readable on any computer or similar device. Contained in this database is a copy of every piece of information ever developed by the Coalition or any of their member races. This includes space tech, medical knowledge, history, and even the most classified of military secrets. It even holds the knowledge of how to make tailored super-plagues of killing off specific species with zero chance of mutation or the plague affecting an undesired species, in addition to the creation of lesser diseases.


-Full Viltrumite Database (Invincible) (600CP)
        You gain a full Viltrumite Empire database that adapts to be readable on any computer or similar device. Contained in this database is a copy of every piece of information ever developed by the Viltrumites or any of their slave races. This includes space tech, medical knowledge, history, and even the most classified of military secrets. It even holds the new invention of how to cure species specific super plagues, and lesser diseases


-GitD Virus 2.0 (Freefall) (600CP)
        With this you have a selective killer. Before unleashing the program somewhere that it can access the offending AIs, you may designate parameters as to which to ignore, harmlessly disable, selectively damage, and which to utterly destroy. This item's effects start out as strong as the canonic virus, but scale up the greater your abilities, hardware used, knowledge of software, and knowledge of target.


-Guide to Super Tech Theory (Justice League Unlimited) (600CP)
        This is some seriously dangerous stuff you're holding on to. These innocent looking books contain detailed information on the final project of the brilliant Professor Ivo, they explain a new type of nanotechnology that seems to combine several different branches of engineering, biology, and various other scientific fields in a way that should be impossible! With some extensive study you can figure out how to replicate this nanotech and create equipment capable of emulating supernatural powers from any source, be it magical, scientific, alien, anything! This science isn't exactly perfect however as you'll have to figure out the power in question before you can copy it, and that's not taking into account how to implement such a power, but that's just the natural progression of super science. If you study hard enough you'll eventually be able to recreate Ivo's ultimate achievement, the ever evolving android known as AMAZO, an artificial being capable of instantly replicating the skills, abilities, equipment, and other properties of any living being it scans.


-IS Lab | Personal IS | IS Education and Training (Infinite Stratos) (600CP)
        IS Lab (600CP)
A state of the art and top secret laboratory cross manufactorum of your very own. While this can certainly accomplish a wide variety of uses as either a lab or a customisable factory to mass produce machines, it's true worth lies in the detailed Infinite Stratos blueprints and instructions that come already inserted into the computers and machines within the lab. This makes this possibly the only place outside of Tabane's personal lab capable of producing IS, as well as one of the very few places that can effectively alter or customise them.
        Personal IS (0CP)
All players get a free Infinite Stratos Mecha personalised to them. See the Infinite Stratos section after the Item section for details on how to create this mecha
        IS Education and Training (0CP)
The Infinite Stratos are terribly complicated things. It takes a lot of knowledge on mathematics and various sciences to operate one and even more to maintain the machines. That's not even getting into the trained reflexes and coordination you need to be able to use an IS for effective combat. Usually you'd learn this over time in school but as a special consideration, you'll have all that knowledge and skill popped into your head, free of charge. You won't be matching an Ace but you can be assured of being proficient.
        Build your own Infinite Stratos in the Jump Document. The options are half the jump document and not copied here as a result.


-Jumper Asteroid (Justice League Unlimited) (600CP)
        Located deep within a treacherous asteroid field, this intimidating extraterrestrial base is a replica of the secret fortress used by the super intelligent kryptonian A.I known as Brainiac. Although it's much smaller than the original this space station is still comparable to the Watchtower in terms of size and internal space and it's built in such a way that a single A.I can operate the facility by itself. While the exterior doesn't have any noticeable features, aside from maybe a gigantic image of your face carved into the rock, the interior houses a large hangar bay, numerous defensive drones, an imposing throne room, and a massive digital library containing information on the culture, history, inhabitants, and technology of over a hundred worlds, including krypton.
        If someone were to study all the archives in this station they would gain incredible insights into robotics, cybernetics, energy weaponry, space travel, A.I, and many other topics from countless space faring civilizations. Enough to build weapons and starships that can pose a serious threat to Earth and Apokolips.
        Additionally this station contains a small fragment of Brainiac itself. The fragment is currently inactive and safe to handle, and while it would be possible for a smart enough individual to reverse engineer Brainiac's most powerful technology from this thing it would come at the cost of possibly awaking the copy of the A.I hidden inside and If that were to happen it would quickly attempt to possess whoever or whatever was nearby to ensure its continued survival, replication, and improvement.
        However someone would have to be as smart as Lex Luthor in order to even have a chance of reactivating this device. If you do manage to get it working however then you'll have a sample of the nanotech Brainiac uses to modify and possess living beings and assimilate alien technology. Aside from replicating the nanotech in this fragment you could also purposefully reawaken the copy of Brainiac stored within and try to use it for your own ends, but this really isn't recommended since it's a crazy murderous A.I that's only interestedin collecting knowledge. If you do manage to reawaken Brainiac it won't count as a companion.
        * Brainiac fragment is a part of this perk


-Library of the Lost (The Games We Play) (600CP)
        Before the current setup rolled around, there were plenty of attempts by people to set up the whole 'civilization' thing. Vedic was an attempt, as were several others, mirroring nations you might recognize from your original world in strange ways. They all had their own discoveries and knowledge, potentially priceless things that were all lost nonetheless, to the relentless march of the Grimm. Not anymore, though. This is a complete, comprehensive collection of all the lost knowledge in the world! Anything that's lost to the world, through the destruction of a civilization, no one speaking the language, or other mishaps, can be found here, explained clearly and plainly, ready to be brought back. This covers everything from martial skills, scientific knowledge to cultural details like Art and the rest. But again, only things that are specifically not in circulation in any real capacity in the modern day and age. Things like the protection skills Jaune acquired from the Mistral libraries can be found here, hunter training methods in active use can't. If this needs to be said at this point, yes, this updates with the equivalent knowledge in all future jumps.
        * Interestingly this is not limited to the planet, it covers every lost civ in the universe or possibly the local multiverse.


-Organic Database (Starcraft - The Zerg) (600CP)
        It's a large, shell-encased... brain. The various wrinkles and lines within it seem to glimmer with green light, and aside from that it seems to be just odd. Within this brain, however, lies everything a growing leader of the Zerg could need to know: The genetic make-up and growth patterns of every Zerg organism ever, from the patterns of evolution that have resulted in the Zergling to the monolithic Leviathans used for inter-plane- tary travel.
        * Overmind is a zerg organism and so are primals and hybrids so this has the info for all of them too.


-PDA | Master Builder (Subnautica) (600CP)
        PDA (0CP)
        Loaded with an emergency intelligence and more data capacity than you could ever use, this is a survivor's second most powerful tool (after his or her brain.) The AI may get a bit . . . quirky . . . over long deployments. Your version is basically indestructible. Contains basic construction blueprints.
        Master Builder (600CP)
        Your PDA gains immediate access to all the blueprints available in Subnautica, as well as a few that can't normally be found. These unique structures are: Ultrasonic Fencing, which ward away hostile wildlife; Hydrogen balloons and a submersible dock for when the hurricanes sweep through; Hydrogen-Fusion plants, which produces extreme energy from seawater; and finally, a robotics bay where you can manufacture automated scavenger bots.


-R&D Tech Database (Mass Effect Andromeda) (600CP)
        You gain access to a database with technology data from the Milky Way. This encompasses a wide variety of fields, from A to Z. Alternatively, you could instead have a similar database encompassing Heleus Cluster civilizations (excluding Remnant Tech). You could also pay an additional 100CP to get both Milky Way and Heleus databases. If you've already bought both of those, you can also pay an additional 200CP for access to a sprawling library of Remnant tech, enough to make Peebee swear eternal servitude to you just to have access to it. If you pay an additional 200CP on top of the Remnant tech option, this database will update per each civilization you interact with. Dead or remnant civilizations will take a bit of a research period before you get an update for them, but when you do, you'll be the envy of any archeological expert in that civilization. But regardless of whatever level you buy, you have a media/cultural/historical archive of each culture/civilization you have the technology of. The dead/remnant civilizations still need to be researched first though.
        * The 600cp cost includes all the upgrades


-Timespinner Blueprints (Timespinner) (600CP)
        The blueprints and schematics for the device known as the Timespinner. It is a form of temporal gateway that is capable of precisely sending a user through time into the past or future. The ordinary version has several limitations, the most important of which is that travelling through it is a one-way trip, and results in the removal of the traveller from history, leaving them as a person without a history on the other side. Similarly, until upgraded by Lachiemi science, the portal only allowed for travel through time, not space, and would deposit the user at the same point, relative to the planet they are on, in whatever era they targeted.
        This version has altered those restrictions. Firstly, it is capable of travelling through both space and time. Secondly, it has a recall function, which allows a user who has travelled through it to 'snap back' to the device the moment after they went through, re-entering their old timeline at that point.
        The device does still retain the restriction that the timeline being travelled to will be one where the user never existed, but the recall function means that they can travel between that timeline and this one as they please. The third restriction is related to that, namely that this device can only target a single 'new' timeline per person per Jump, and thus that as they travel around in the new timeline and make changes, they will be making changes to the same timeline, even when they shift back and forth between the old and new timelines.
        It is possible to bring back objects from the new timeline into the old timeline, or vice versa, but not people. Finally, this Timespinner has safeguards to ensure that no matter how much you mess with time, it will not cause an existential breakdown or destroy the universe (which could be a danger with the normal Timespinner, or that might just be a lie told by the Sandman). This purchase does come with the necessary materials to make a single Timespinner, which will replenish at the beginning of each new Jump. A Timespinner can only target times and spaces within the current Jump.
        * Worse than the tardis but the protection feature is unique


-Tinker Data Core (Worm) (600CP)
        A computer containing a database of Tinker-Tech, including documentation, analysis, and blueprints. There's enough information here to advance science centuries should everything in here get properly examined and reverse engineered, although doing so would be the work of a lifetime or two. Still enough to keep a company several years ahead of its competitors for a very long time. This doesn't include all such tech in the Wormverse by any means, but barring some extraordinary effort or circumstances on your part it's the closest you'll ever get.


-Amazo's Backup Memory (Young Justice) (800CP)
        This memory stick contains the encrypted memories of the android Amazo, and more importantly, contains the information on how the android replicated the abilities of the Justice League. After breaking the encryption you will have all the information you need to incorporate superhuman abilities you possess into your technology, creating machines that speak to each other with telepathy, process information with super speed, lift great weights with actual super strength and more.


-Damaged Microchip (Terminator) (800CP)
        While this looks like the damaged CPU from the first Terminator that Cyberdyne used to help build Skynet, it is actually a storage device. This contains information on just about everything that Skynet has ever produced. From the modified T-1 and small Hunter Killers, to the T3000 and Large Hunter Killer Tanks and Walkers. Even information on how to build an AI as advanced as Skynet is in here, along with Time Travel technology. The problem is, not only is the coding not understandable by the average computer, but the damage to it has eliminated some coding. Nothing vital to the schematics, but it is now even harder to piece the information together. It is unlikely to get all of the information out without 100 years of work.


-Omnitrix (Ben 10 0.1) (800CP)
        This will one day be called the mightiest weapon in the universe. It is the magnum opus of the genius Galvan Azmuth and, should things proceed as normal, will spark the legend of Ben Tennyson, a superhero with the power of many aliens. With this purchase, you now have your very own. The Omnitrix is a database of alien DNA that allows the user to temporarily transform into a copy of that very same species, with all the strengths and weaknesses therein, before changing back to normal. This device is both insanely versatile and capable, so let's see what we can do to personalize your own version of it. For this section, you receive +1000 Omnitrix Points, or OP. You may gain additional OP by converting choice points on a 1:1 ratio, getting 50 OP for 50 CP and so forth. You may not convert OP back to Choice Points, in case it needs to be said.


-Orb Design Plans (Swat Kats) (800CP)
        Well... this is curious. The design plans for a Micro-Brain Repair Unit... this won't show up for some time, but it is quite useful nonetheless. Once assembled, it will have the ability to scan and repair any damaged machinery it comes across, simply by using the materials around it. The more advanced the machine is, the longer it will take... but it will do its job. Even more concerningly, it has the ability to learn and adapt itself, assimilating machinery to create a more grand body. It may come with existential issues... are you sure you want this?


-The Holy Grail (Girl Genius SB) (800CP)
        Well not quite, but it might as well be. This is something literally any spark in this world would kill for, something that, if it were out in the open, would cause a furore that would make the Long War look like a childish squabble. Attached to your warehouse is an archive holding a complete, unabridged, detailed history of this world, all the way from the dawn of the very first civilization to the second before you enter the world. Every war stratagem, every population census, the name of every ruler, it's all recorded here in extensive detail. But that's not what would attract people to it like moths to a flame. That would be the Scientific archive. Because you see, this archive also holds literally every scrap of knowledge this world has ever discovered or used. Every novel or book ever written, every scientific principle discovered, every paper, journal article or private message, the blueprints for each and every device made throughout the history of the planet, the details of the Second Breakthrough... everything. Don't go showing it off, yeah? In future worlds too, this updates to hold the same level of information on local things.
        * Sparks make some crazy good stuff


-The Ruins (DOOM 3) (800CP)
        One of the most important fields of research in the UAC Mars base involves physics, dimensional technologies, organic technology, and many more things but it starts with history. Beneath the base lies a vast network of ruins, burial chambers and other structures belonging to the long-dead inhabitants of Mars - a people that some theorize are in fact the ancient progenitors of humanity itself. Though heavily damaged and weathered by the passage of time, many of the devices within still function, and the inscriptions recovered from the Martian dig sites have contained information beyond anything humanity understood - leading to some of the most advanced scientific theories of the modern day. You are now in charge of a sizable dig site working through these ruins, with direct authority over the discoveries made within. In future worlds, you will likewise come into possession of a similarly vast Archaeological site, belonging to a suitably powerful precursor from the setting you are in. Predicting what kind of advances might be realized through investigating these ruins will be difficult but no matter what, results will always be spectacular in some way.


-Unabridged Memory Banks (Green Lantern) (800CP)
        Ooh. The Guardians would go apeshit if they knew you had this. This is a full-fledged, unabridged copy of the Oan archives, the sum total of the Guardians and the Green Lantern corps' history and knowledge base. Somewhere deep in these records there is even the lore of harnessing emotional lights and making lantern rings, but it took the hyper-intelligent guardians literal ages in time and untold amounts of resources to do it, so...y'know. If you have a power ring this data is placed in its memory banks, but you can get it in any other medium that you desire as well.


-Armorer | Fixer | Weaponsmith (Light of Terra DLC 5 - A Sky Filled With Steel) (900CP)
        Armourer (300CP)
        A mental database containing information on the most common types of armour found in the Necromunda Hive and how to build, repair and maintain them. While this doesn't sound impressive, it is worth pointing out there are countless billions of people dwelling within the hive, and they have been here for millenia - the list of things counted as common at one time or another ranges from Power Armour in the distant past to the more common hammered metal plates made by local Gangers to the standard Imperial Guard Carapace Armour. Don't expect to start churning out Adetus Astartes Power Armour the second you get this though - the infrastructure to build the infrastructure to build the infrastructure to build the armour was lost to ruin a long time ago. There's a reason the Space Marines use suits that are thousands of years old.
        Fixer (300CP)
        This Schema contains a massive database filled with the countless bits of equipment the denizens of Necromunda Hive Primus have bought, found, built, stolen or obtained by other means over the centuries since the Hive was founded. Inexplicably it also seems to contain an extremely rare, extremely valuable and extremely heretical to own database detailing how to build and maintain Admech servitors and cybernetic parts.
        Weaponsmith (300CP)
        To weaponry what Armourer is to protective gear, this is a massive database of the various tools of mayhem the denizens of the Necromunda hive have wielded against each other. While the high tech equipment possible may seem nice, do not underestimate the value of low tech weaponry. Crafting a plasma pistol and crafting a bayonet require wildly different sets of skills, and all too often people who have one assume they have the other, to their chagrin


-Complete Techbase (Orion's Arm: Sephirotic Empires) (1800CP)
        This 30km long ship is a repository of information of all of Orion's Arm's techbase. Yes, this includes all examples of godtech and xenotech.

-Shadow Clones (Generic Naruto Fanfiction) (100CP)
        Ah, shadow clone no jutsu. The signature jutsu of the Naruto franchise. And now you can join in on the fun. You have a copy of a technique scroll for the shadow clone jutsu, of such quality that an idiot could teach himself from this thing in virtually no time at all. It even has safeguards built-in that eliminate any possibility of killing yourself by putting too much chakra into it, or getting a headache from too many clones dispelling at once or anything like that. The worst that can possibly happen is that it fails to work. You still can only make as many shadow clones as your chakra can support but outside of that you can feel free to abuse this handy jutsu for training, decoys, diversions, paperwork, chores, or whatever else you can imagine. In the event that this technique is supposed to have some additional features in the particular fanfiction you go to, or even a better version, this scroll will contain both versions.
        * Some of the best shadow clone fanfic features include shadow clone self charka regeneration, temporal split clones instead of normal clones, mind merging without dispel, constant hivemind like connection etc


-Abstract and Decoder Ring (Marvel Comics Kid Superheroes) (200CP)
        A book which contains the past, present and future of the Gibborim and their servants, the Pride, as well as the rites of sacrifice that bind the two. Plus dark secrets, black magic and forgotten scientific lore that the Pride used to enhance their powers and skills. Comes with a decoder ring to enable translation. Not for the squeamish or faint of heart.


-Book of Basic Formations (Desolate Era Part I - The Three Realms) (200CP)
        A book detailing the various ways formations work and how to master the basics. With such good instructions, anyone could begin to learn the Dao of Formations, although its eventual mastery depends on your own effort and skill. The book updates to be appropriate to your level of cultivation, so it'll never be useless.
        * Not just a type of runes, you will need resources to make anything, quite expensive ones too.


-Forbidden Book of Attribute Metals (The Death Mage Who Doesn't Want A Fourth Time) (200CP)
        Death Iron and Dark Copper, Life Gold and Soul Silver. Metals created by the esteemed dhampir Vandalieu using his Death magic and raw metals, changing the metals into more powerful forms on par with adamantite and Mythril, or into rare and unique metals capable of influencing the soul and body themselves. While this option does not give you said metal, what you are instead given is a guide on how to imbue Attribute mana into metals to create entirely new forms. These new metals will each be unique in some way, such as being liquid until heated a great deal, and will in turn each possess powerful and useful abilities related to their element. A liquid metal that heals those who eat it and metal that somehow affects the soul itself, this and other effects unknown and untold are yours for the discovering. Just note, however, that a great deal of mana will be required, and perhaps a method to speed it all along.
        * Existing examples are death magic
        * Death iron: Better than steel, liquid until heated, self repairing, only forgable by undead, easier to enchant with death magic
        * Dark Copper: Impact resistent, liquid until heated, self repairing, only forgable by undead, easier to enchant with death magic
        * Soul Silver: Used to make life with a soul in setting,
        * Life Gold: Heals people who eat it.
        * Attributes include Fire, Water, Earth, Wind, Light, Time, Space, Life, death. Fanwank each metal combined with each magic, assume that it probably doesn't touch the soul since that's death magics thing, and is easier to enchant with same attribute magic, and it might not be immediately combat useful.


-Forbidden Book of the Craft (The Death Mage Who Doesn't Want A Fourth Time) (200CP)
        Weapons. Armor. Tools. All are needed in daily life, all to build, to hunt, to thrive. And where do they come from when one does not live in human society, where there is not a mine to be found or a field to grow plants or animals in? Monsters. The scales of dragons, the claws of wyverns, the bones of dinosaurs, from all of these things can tools be made, though it would take someone who is quite creative to figure out how some of them can be made. That's where this comes in, as detailed within this book are guides on what can be made from which animals, which plants, and which monsters, as well as where all of its components can be found. Plate armor from a dragon's scales, a spear from a wyvern's claw, a club from a dinosaur's bones, all this and much more are described within, though the exact techniques to combine these materials will be left to you.
        * Standard fantasy fare.


-Golem Formula (Generic Isekai) (200CP)
        This is a set of instructions on the creation and control of simple humanoid golems, made from earth, stone or wood. The golems it describes are weaker than a human adult, but tireless and mindlessly obedient to their creator. Though casting the creation spell is costly for a beginner, it is not impossible, and will grow easier with practice. Comes with one golem premade.


-Inkgate Schemata (Van Helsing) (200CP)
        Normally one only finds these in Borgovia, where the 'veil' between the real world and the Ink is thinnest. Also mostly as the 'Ink' is practically unknown outside of Borgovia. Regardless, the Inkgates you can learn to create with this schematic will allow you to use the inky blackness between worlds as a method of teleportation. These gates, once made, are indestructible - but unfortunately (or fortunately) can be used by anyone so long as they know the command word. Note: Interplanetary Inkgate systems are slightly outside of the schematic parameters.


-Ritualist's Library (Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) (200CP)
        You have here a great treasure trove of knowledge; a library of books from ritualists across the world, since the time of Merlin onwards. Each of these tomes is a copy of the personal notes of a powerful magus who researched and recorded at least one ritual. These notes are incredibly useful, containing several potent rituals, but that's not what's special about them. The real power in this library lies in something it lacks; the Interdict of Merlin. The books in this trove bypass the Interdict, allowing anyone who reads one to learn magic sealed behind that ancient law without the aid of another living mind.


-Schoolbooks (Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality) (200CP)
        You gain a collection of all of your school materials for a seven year course at Hogwarts (assuming Defense Against the Dark Arts is taught by a competent professor assigning a high-quality set text for all seven years, so in reality probably a bit better in that regard), as well as Muggle school up through British Secondary School. Learning and teaching from these books is easier than normal, enough to almost make up for a lack of an instructor. Lost or gifted books are replaced via owl order within one week at no cost to you. Yes, even if there's no logical way for an owl to reach you with a full set of magical textbooks. If your starting age is above 11, you're assumed to have been learning at an appropriate pace from these books for however long you've been at Hogwarts, or should have been at Hogwarts in the case of a Drop-In. Post-Jump, anyone studying from a set of magic textbooks which they own gains the ability to use Atlantean Magic. Gifted and re-gifted books never lose the magic-granting ability, stolen books do not grant magic until returned to the rightful owner.


-Youma Books (Touhou Forbidden Hermit) (200CP)
You have a collection of supernatural books, such as grimoires written by magicians, valuable historical texts about supernatural occurrences, letters soaked in feelings until they began to take a life of their own, and books written by youkai to record their own existence. Includes the first Japanese translation of the Necronomicon. Be careful of thieves.


-Bio-Alchemical Theory Books (Fullmetal Alchemist) (300CP)
        Crosses between Medicine, Alchemy, and Biology. Chimeras are extremely complex beings, requiring knowledge of all of these.


-Completed research (Dungeon Keeper) (300CP)
        This thick tome holds detailed mechanical and arcane notes that will teach you how to build and use all the keeper spells, rooms, traps and mechanisms within the Dungeon Keeper series. This also includes the personal spells used by individual units, from the lightning used by dark mistresses to the tricks imps use to dig, claim territory and reinforce walls.


-Grimoire of Demon Lord Raum (The Dark Wolf Shiro) (300CP)
        Created by the now dead Demon Lord ancestor of Grayson Raum for his future descendents this grimoire is the result of thousands of years of research by one of the most powerful demon lords of Hell and is chock full of demonic spells, potion recipes and who knows what else. Now, you possess a copy of this grimoire whether created by the same demon lord or a copy of it, it doesn't matter it's yours now.


-Do it yourself Dungeon heart (Dungeon Keeper Ami) (400CP)
        Not exactly a dungeon heart, this is actually a book explaining how to make the gold powered dungeon hearts found on the avatar islands, though it relies less on the power of the dark gods for mana it also has a much lower output than the older model organic dungeon hearts. While a person can be made a keeper using this kind of heart and existing keepers can use them as well it has many flaws such as the inability to create living imps, having a much much lower mana output than normal keeper hearts, requiring large amounts of gold in order for it to create mana as a normal heart would. On the plus side you can change its looks to some extent, generally it will keep the glowing orb in the center in some fashion but the other parts can be changed into quite a few different designs from plant statues, to bones, even a small crystal pyramid.


-Grand Library (Dishonored 2) (400CP)
        Built of dark grey stone and the rich wood of Serkonos's mountain forests, the grand library seems embedded with a chasm, crossed with catwalks and bridges. It contains thousands of books, painstakingly hand-written on occult and metaphysical topics, and hundreds of years of research on the astronomy and metaphysics of the world can be found in their leather covers. While rare diamonds of practical knowledge are scattered between the books, the more academic literature is likely to help you in developing your own magics or rituals. The Grand Library updates for each new jump, adding further shelves of books along grey stone escarpments, and providing a comprehensive academic knowledge base of the metaphysics, magic and dimensions of your local setting, though it will not contain books which already exist. The Grand Library attaches to your Cosmic Warehouse or other pocket dimension.


-Library (Touhou Luna Nights) (400CP)
You have a copy of the Scarlet Devil Mansion’s library. It’s very extensively furnished with grimoires and other books containing extensive information on magical arts and the world around you. You could easily teach yourself or someone else any magic in this series with the contents of the library, if you had the patience to study the vast trove of wisdom.


-Library of Sorrow (Skulduggery Pleasant) (400CP)
        China Sorrows is many things, but above all else, she is a collector of all things magical. Nowhere is this more apparent than in her library, a home to many lost and obscure magical tomes. Now, it seems you have come to possess a library of your own, equally massive and chock full of rare, obscure, and lost magical knowledge. In future Jumps, this library will update and expand to encompass the vast majority of that world's historical magical knowledge, barring tomes that are one-of-a-kind. You'll need to get those yourself.


-Notes of Thoth (Kane Chronicles) (400CP)
        When Thoth, the god of writing, knowledge, and magic was young, he traveled to the far reaches of the Duat, researching the natures and mechanics of those regions, as well as the spirits and gods that called those places home. His field notes - and the many powers and dangerous spells that resulted from them, later became known as the Book of Thoth. By purchasing this, you gain a collection of his notes about the nature of gods, spirits, and other dimensions and planes of existence in this setting, which could be used to invent many of the spells the Book contained for yourself. Post-jump, these notes will update to include the local versions of such things in new settings.


-Roman Manuals and Gallic Recipes (Asterix the Gaul) (400CP)
        These are a collection of every potion seen in the series, and also every single artefact, such as the collapsing chariots for one, ever used by a roman. Thrown in are all the mundane materials such as Gallic food and medicine recipes, wine-making tricks...if it counts as a recipe used by the Gallic people at this point of time or any time previously, it's in this collections, just as every single item that could be considered a Roman manual, including the details for their roads, their galleys, their military doctrine, all are collated into the manuals.


-Time Circuitry (Marvel Magic) (400CP)
        There are those with the power to turn even the currents of time itself against you. But you have methods of defending yourself. These schematics show you what is required to integrate time circuitry into other technology, perhaps as cybernetics or for your armor. While worn or otherwise integrated with your body, you will be protected from temporal manipulations, be it attempts to freeze you in time, cast you adrift in its flows, or even to kill your past self. You need never again fear such attacks so long as you wear this armor. If you bought the Magitech Armor above then you may choose to already have this integrated.


-Uchiha Jutsu Archive (Generic Naruto Fanfiction) (400CP)
        The Uchiha really were quite shameless in their day, always going around copying everybody else's lifetimes of hard work just by using their special eyes. Well, at least you get to benefit from that. Somehow you've obtained a copy of the complete Uchiha Jutsu Archive, everything that several generations of dedicated intellectual property thieves could copy from every other ninja village, clan and small ninja child in the Elemental Nations. Pretty much any and every technique, seal, chemical formula, pill/cookie recipe or random dance routine that that one Uchiha liked can be found in here. Any knowledge that wasn't limited to literally just one person, family, or bloodline or was based purely on sealless chakra manipulation (such as the Rasengan) and thus uncopyable by the Sharingan is in the archive, all of them laid out in such a clear and concise format that any half-competent ninja could teach himself just by reading the scroll. This archive will update with a complete set of spells, fighting styles, etc, etc. from any setting that you have visited and will visit in the future. Provided it could be generously called public, or even semi-private, knowledge it will be in here. Only the most super-secret, utterly private techniques are missing; after all, even the best copyright pirates can't get everything. This place is comprehensively warded against thievery, somewhat ironically, and it would take a team of top-tier infiltration specialists to even attempt to breach it. Of course its best defense is that, at least at jump start, no one knows you have it. Post jump you can have this become a warehouse attachment.


-Mystical Dojo | Chakra Books (Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol.2) (500CP)
        Mystical Dojo (400CP)
        For the Masters of the Mystic Arts, the grounds of Kamar- Taj is their sanctuary, their fortress, and their school all in one. It is a place where they can open their mind, and truly ascend to new heights in awareness as they explore Creation itself. Alas... even they knew not to focus everything in one place, and it is with that in mind that I offer you this. Whether you wish to place this in a mountain range so that it is hidden away from the eyes of most, or have it as a Warehouse attachment, this ancient site contains everything one needs to build an order. Rooms for monks to stay in, a great library to fill with many books, a courtyard to practice, an armory for magical items you may possess, and even a storage unit that supplies as much mundane food, water, and tea to sate those who follow the Mystic Arts. Even better, those who practice here will find their minds opening more quickly than usual, having an accelerated effect that will leave training of the body and mystical practices half again as effective. ...oh, and there's a wifi router installed.
        Chakra Books (100CP)
        It can be difficult for those who are unaware of the world around them to grasp that they know nothing. It can also be difficult to show them just how small their worldview has been all this time, or help them. But the first step to learning is awareness. This is a substantial supply of books regarding the body, such as a map of the nervous system, MRIs, and more importantly, chakra points and how to just open them. These maps for the body will help bring awareness to would-be students, and how to show them the wonders of the world or themselves. For an additional undiscounted 100CP, you may also gain a substantial collection of spellbooks that will assist in helping you learn the formation of spells, the art of drawing energies to power them, and the basics in casting them. Just be aware that the warning labels come AFTER the spells.
        * The cost includes the upgrade


-Archamada Book of Spells (Ben 10) (600CP)
        In this book you will find some of the strongest spells in the known universe. You can find spells that summon town destroying storms, bring statues to life, and even allow you to travel through time. These spells require a lot of power and skill to use, so you better be ridiculously strong (or at least have a strong source of magic to draw on) and really good if you plan to use them. The time travel spell won't actually work until you're done jumping, though.


-Library of Raum (The Dark Wolf Shiro) (600CP)
        The biggest library of magical knowledge in all of Europe and most likely the world. This library is chock full of all types of spells, potions, runes, history, forbidden magic you name it. This library has it. But that alone is not what makes this a 600 CP purchase what makes it that is in future jumps this fills with every slip of magical knowledge in that world even those that were never written down or even lost to time it's all there and don't worry you keep the knowledge of past worlds/jumps too.
        * This is from an extremely OP HP fanfic, demon and god magic flavored


-Magnus Recipe (God Catching Alchemy Meister) (600CP)
        To become a Magnus in the Alchemist Guild you need a grand project, something that puts your name and face in the minds of alchemists throughout the world. This is obviously a difficult task, but this little notebook is an amalgamation of notes and ideas that could elevate you to the rank of Magnus once joined and implemented. You may select the precise nature of what the final form of this project is, but it will be at the level of a sword that nulls magic, a potion that cures all diseases or armor that makes the user immune to physical attacks.


-Old Fashioned Magic (Youjo Senki - Saga of Tanya the Evil) (600CP)
        A collection of magical implements from before the days of industrialization. In other words, mystical books full of strange rituals, handcrafted wands and staves, strange reagents, and heavy robes and wizard hats. Unlikely to ever match an Orb for raw power or speed. However, they come with an interesting inversion. Over the years of being used, ambient magic has seeped into them. Even someone with no magical potential could make use of the things found here.


-Tattered Journal (Highschool DxD) (600CP)
        Where'd you get this? This is an old journal written by a Fallen Angel of unknown origin. It's written in both an old language and in code, but if you were to translate it, you would eventually discover details on a powerful magical art - the art of sealing powerful entities, even contradictory ones, into a single vessel to create artifacts similar to Sacred Gears. These items would gain a host of powers from the being that was sealed away, though the ritual is costly depending on how strong said being is...perhaps you could find a use for it?


-Stuff You Need To Know About Asauchi (Bleach 4.03) (800CP)
        Written by Oetsu Nimaiya, this Notebook describes the process, techniques, and materials used in his creation of the first few Asauchi. For starters, you need a blacksmith's forge, a menos class hollow, some ridiculously hot flames, and a small ocean of water to cool it off afterwards. Mind you, this book only details the first few Asauchi, whom Oetsu declared failures. Making a 'proper' Asauchi will require time and experimentation.


-The Great Library (Warlock of The Magus World) (800CP)
        The Great Library is located in your Warehouse, and is set up above a gigantic spell formation and is being managed by a sentient spirit genie, which obviously is totally loyal to you, and you alone. It's in charge of all management, and while there aren't any guards stationed here, there will never be any incident happen here. The huge library could be said to have everything. Its information was not limited to that about the Magus World and World of Gods; there was data about other worlds as well. There was a large bright hall past the entrance that could hold over a thousand people without becoming crowded. At the middle were hundreds of tables, and what looked like terminals, of which one can use to browse through the information the library has. Further in from the data terminals and the hall was the gigantic library that resembled a palace. Some sort of technique had been employed to expand the space within. At a glimpse, one would see bookshelves as massive as mountains, all so densely packed and numerous that there seemed to be no end.
        Upon visiting any Worlds/Jumps/Dimensions, the library also updates to contain every public information, including any data that you can easily acquire if you put your mind to it, of that Worlds and its neighbor, which include other dimensions. And will continuously update, self-correct and improve any information it has. As long as it's information that the spirit genie has a backup of, it can be duplicated as anything you want, such as books, scrolls, data pad, storage drive, etc, as long as you have the materials required. It can contain an immeasurable amount of data, and will never forget it. Even if the data has already been updated and improved or even if the timeline changes, it will still contain the old versions.
        You can place the Great Library in the real world, letting in all kinds of people to exchange for information, you can freely set the payment. Such as making it so that to obtain information inside, one needs to give it information that the library did not have, paying your preferred currencies to view it, or doing some mission you set out to gain access to it. It will be completely normal for everyone, and won't trigger any red flag, taxes, government authority, copyright infringement, Gods, World Will, etc. You can freely set which information is public, which requires payment, and which is never to be seen by the public. Its information can never be copied, stolen or otherwise accessed without your permission and knowledge.
        If it somehow is destroyed, it will return to your Warehouse/Personal Reality with none worse for the wear. Those other than you and your companions cannot use the library to access your Warehouse/Personal Reality.
        If you have the A.I. Chip, then it can always be connected to the Great Library. Allowing you to control the Great Library remotely while providing you with it continuously updating and self-correcting information anytime, anyplace. Or if you wish you can choose for the library to become virtual and stored in your chip.


-The Hands of the Maker (Generic Exalted) (800CP)
        You have gained a forbidden knowledge. A dusty tome has come into your possession and within it dwells the secrets of producing Alchemical Exalted, one of the greatest creations ever made by a Titan devoted to Craft. It could take a hundred mortal lifetimes to glean even the barest secrets of this knowledge, though one who is Exalted above others might manage it in as little as one. It contains instructions on how to make all the various types of Alchemical Exalted and, unlike the Alchemicals that were first created, these instructions show how to create improved versions. Ones that are immune to the dread sickness that so afflicted the Maker and far less susceptible to the vagaries of Clarity.
        This is only the knowledge to create these beings, and someone that desires to make use of this knowledge will need to secure the materials, infrastructure, and other reagents needed on their own. The Jumper, and only the Jumper, is guaranteed to one day be able to make Alchemical Exalts if they study this, even if they wouldn't normally be capable of such, though it may take a very long time indeed. While you may discover the method of the creation of Alchemicals, how their Exaltation itself is formed will elude you, no matter what method you attempt, until such time as you have gained your Spark.
        Further you will discover that no method you are capable of will be able to utilize the Alchemical Exaltation for anything other than powering the Alchemical that it has attached itself to. This, too, will be something that will be beyond your comprehension until such a time as you have gained your Spark. As a reminder Alchemicals were once people and while the process may have changed them both in looks and abilities they are people still. So unless you take them as companions, or have some other method of bringing them with you into future worlds, you will not be able to take them with you. Finally the process of making an Alchemical does not infuse into them any sort of loyalty to you, so beware if you have used this knowledge to force this condition upon the unwilling.


-The Quincy Alphabet (Bleach 4.03) (800CP)
        This is Yhwach's diary. It's pink, covered in glitter, and it looks like it's written in 57 different languages. Good luck translating it. But if you do manage to do so, and I can assure you ten years isn't enough time to do so, it contains instructions on everything Quincy related. From how to lobotomize your own soul and give it to others, thus making them Quincy, to how to reintegrate those pieces, and how to make the Schrift out of them. Also contains instructions on how to make all of the Quincy weaponry. The Bankai stealing medallion is notably absent.


-Spell Models | Magus Cultivation | Wizard Cultivation | High Grade Meditation Technique (Warlock of The Magus World) (1500CP)
        Spell Models (600CP)
In this world before a Magus can cast a spell they must first comprehend a spell model. To put it into perspective the spiritual force is the primer, and the spell model is the catalyst. The primer remains the same, but under the effect of different catalysts, different types of energy particles will be attracted to it to form a different spell. Nowadays, spell models are very hard to find in this day and age especially if you do not possess any backing and it would be so rude if you were to be sent to a world as dangerous as this without any protection wouldn't it so for the prices set above you can purchase spell models.
        For 50 CP you can purchase rank 1-2 spell models.
        For 100 CP you can purchase rank 3-4 spell models.
        For 150 CP you can purchase rank 5-6 spell models.
        For 200 CP you can purchase rank 6-7 spell models.
        For 300 CP you can purchase rank 8-9 spell models.
        With each purchase you can buy 5 spells e.g. for 50 CP you can buy 5 rank 1 or 2 spells. Of course, you can purchase Wizard/Arcanist spell models here too. Or for a cost of 600 you may gain a book with every single spell ever developed in this setting, unfortunately it will not update in future jumps.
        * Find the text of Magus Cultivation, Wizard Cultivation and High Grade Meditation Technique in Potion Grandmaster
        * If you already have those perks then subtract 900 from the cost of this
        * You need cultivation to use the spells so these extra perks are needed.

-Designs (Arcanum Of Steamworks And Magic Obscura) (50CP)
        This small portfolio contains any three schematics of your choice, out of any you might find in Arcanum. You may choose both standard technologies such as the Feather Weight Axe and Elephant Rifle, as well as prototype inventions that aren't found in the curriculum of the technological disciplines, such as those for the Miracle Cure, Electro Armor or Tranquilizer Gun.


-Ar Tonelico? (Ar Tonelico) (200CP)
        A device the size of a basketball, overlapping wings that shelter a golden core. Whoever assembled it left a big shiny key inserted into the top? Mysterious. Comes with its recipe, as well as the recipes for two weapons, armours, vehicles, accessories and restoratives of your preference all of the highest quality.
        * The Ar tonelico is a sonic detonator, roughly equivalent to an H-Bomb in destructive power. It is a flawed, miniaturised form of Ar Tonelico's power conversion and emission systems minus the Orgel.


-Gem furnace schematics (Dungeon Keeper Ami) (200CP)
        The secret to Empress Mercury's wealth has never been obtained by any who have attempted to find its origin but you have something that may just be able to one day rival her great wealth. These schematics detail a large furnace powered by magic and technology, once a day it produces Gemstones of your choice though it requires occasional cleaning to keep it in good working order. Please be warned people here would kill for this at the least, or make the price of gemstones plummet.


-HardTech Psi-Detector (Trinity) (200CP)
        You have acquired a Nippon-made device, one of the very few non-biotech devices capable of reliably detecting nearby Psions and psionic powers in use. Most are massive, power-hungry, and have a range of only about five meters . This one has the same range, but is far more efficient and only the size of a large book. Though pretty much useless to a Psion in the field, the device can be connected to mundane security and sensor systems, and you have the blueprints to make more.


-Potions And Rituals (Make A Wish) (300CP)
        You gain a detailed blueprint and design theory of that item, whether it be spell matrices of a spell, charms and engineering required for some magi-tech, or the ingredients and method required for a potion, post jump these blueprints and formulas change to the native settings resources
        Philosopher's Sand (100CP)
        Used by Mr. Black, this item comes in the shape of a silver hourglass filled with blood red powder of the philosopher's stone, which can be used to create the Elixir of Life, capable of granting anyone up to 15 years of life.
        Re'em Blood and Pill (200CP)
        Re'em blood in a flask used by Mr. Black to increase his strength and the pill to make him scentless and help in controlling his strength.


-OrgoTek Bioware Database (Trinity) (400CP)
        A large and comprehensive store of both theory and blueprints, this contains detailed notes on everything made by OrgoTek and its subsidiaries. This includes everything from commercial hardtech products to military-grade VARGs and BioVARGs, biotech space fighters, and lots of bioware commonly used by Psions. This doesn't contain every bit of tech in the Trinity universe, and does not hold schematics for the most advanced computers and the Tesser drives that are integral to Leviathan construction. But it's still a major technological resource.


-Blueprints | Research Notes | Dark Journal (Van Helsing) (600CP)
        Blueprints (200CP)
        An archive of scrolls, each holding the plans & blueprints for numerous gadgets & pieces of equipment notably used by vampire hunters - in particular, the Van Helsing clan. Spring-loaded blade traps hidden in one's hat are among the simplest of things one can make here.
        Research Notes (200CP)
        A tome of notes compiled by numerous doctors in biology, including one Doctor Frankenstein. These notes detail much about biological make-up of different creatures. But... wait, what's this? A hidden flap in the last half of the tome reveals a smaller book - filled to the brim with dark, scientific knowledge.
        With this knowledge, you are capable of creating life - creating monsters like Adam, creatures sewn from flesh and defying the laws of reality by their mere existence.
        Dark Journal (200CP)
        An inconspicuous, black leather journal. Not that big, so you wouldn't expect much. It's contents prove surprising however - for what you hold is no ordinary journal, but possibly the largest composition of necromantic rituals in existence. Each page details the rituals required to create - and control - a great variety of undead monsters. Ranging from ghouls, ghosts, and skeletons to vampires & even more monstrous beings, you'll have no lack of possible minions. Note: The rituals for higher-powered undead will take more material - and more time - to enact.
        * If you check the Van helsing jumpchain, just below the blueprints, research notes and dark journal, it mentions that all of these are written by the same person and having all of them will let you combine the last pages from each book, in order to construct, and I quote, technological marvels and monstrous creations unlike any other. It apparently merges science technology and magic in seamless harmony.


-Future Data (World Seed) (600CP)
        Now, what interesting little thing do you have here? It seems like somehow, you have the fully compiled data and knowledge from the entirety of Neolife, an artificial future set 3000 years after the current time, all contained within a tiny little USB stick. This includes technology and magitech schematics, the research on countless spells and abilities, a bestiary and the aura-makeup of nigh-any creature and animal ever recorded, star maps, and even all the movies and songs known at that point in time. It isn't limited to a single galaxy, but rather contains data from the entire universe in Neolife. Let alone several lifetimes, you'd probably need an entire planet worth of people sifting through those records for the same amount of time if you want to catalogue everything.
        But believe me, it is very much worth the effort. If you shared this with the galactic community, you'd be able to prevent many possible and very real problems from popping up, and everyone could get their foot in the door that much sooner.
        Perhaps even more interestingly, this USB stick will update itself as you travel to other worlds, granting you the same data about their own futures, and even works retroactively, covering settings you have been to in the past. Of course, that's only if they even have a future. Exactly from how far off in the future you get this data depends on how far along the society of a world is. If you spent ten years in a setting fighting dinosaurs, well, the records you get might be from a few dozen million years in the future, while starting on a 21st century Earth would give you data a few thousand years in the future as normal, give or take.


-Future Plans (Fate/Grand Order - Part One) (600CP)
        The Chaldea organisation has, in the past few years, created a variety of pieces of technology that are closer to being miracles than any sort of magic or science of the modern day. Observing the past, transferring the minds/spirits of beings in the present to other times, combining the Heroic Spirits of the past with living beings in the modern day, this group has made some awe inspiring stuff. The hard drive before you has the collected research, notes and findings on every piece of technology and magic utilised by the Chaldea organisation. Their great technologies and their small spells, how they came to understand and make these things is all collected within this one electronic database. With careful study and research, you'll be able to replicate them all even in future worlds and perhaps to even greater effect, if you spend the needed time.


-Great Library of The Heavens (I Saved Too Many Girls And Caused The Apocalypse) (600CP)
        A perfect copy of the library in Laputa, and the key to understanding their astonishing technology. It holds the same knowledge as the original, from flying ships, secret martial techniques to a record of all species on the planet and technology that won't be developed until thousands of years in the future. It's the same knowledge that made the people in Laputa grow lazy and conformist, so be careful.


-Necronium Depletion (GURPS Technomancer) (600CP)
        When magic was introduced to the world, it seemed like an absolute advantage for those who had it over those who didn't. Fortunately, there was a magic bullet - or more accurately, an anti magic bullet. You've mastered the ability to create Depleted Necronium, a special metal that can utterly negate the effects of magic, treating it as nonexistent whenever it would matter. A DN bullet would ignore a Mage's bullet ward, while a DN sword would treat the flesh of a Mage who'd turned into air as, well, flesh instead of harmlessly slicing through air. Interestingly, your particular formula extends to all supernatural effects.


-Ran'Tao's Notes - The Origin Of The Bount (Bleach 4.03) (600CP)
        These notes contain the records and details of each experiment done by the scientist Ran'Tao, including the failed Bount Experiment. This even includes a few of her own personal thoughts and ideas. Maybe these can be of some use to you. In addition, the prototype of the doll summoning ritual can be found inside. Naturally just the notes would probably be useless to you, so if you purchase them here you are guaranteed, with time, study, and effort, to at least be capable of recreating her work. With even more time, and considerable genius on your part, you might even be able to improve on it.


-Relic Of The Future (I Saved Too Many Girls And Caused The Apocalypse) (600CP)
        The lost technology that allowed Atlantis to maintain itself for as long as it did. These are the notes and blueprints revealing the secret of the 'space-time stitching' technology. Once everything is properly set, it can send back the user in time, much like the 'save' function in a game. It can't go before the machine itself was activated, nor it stops the user from getting older as they experience those futures.


-Starro-tech Notes (Young Justice) (600CP)
        These notes detail the research Professor Ivo, Brain, and Klarion the Witch Boy took in order to create Starro-tech; a combination of technology, magic, and an ancient alien organism. With time, and some studies of your own, you may be able to apply the principles of Starro-tech to your creations as well, creating technology and creatures that have features of living beings, magic, and technology.


-Technical Specialist | Forceful Engineer | Extragalactic Tech (Star Wars - Darth Bane Trilogy) (700CP)
        Technical Specialist (300CP)
It is arguable that this galaxy has, on the whole, reached a technological plateau. This bar may be relatively high if one was to compare it to that of previous Jumps. Sentient computer systems, widely available commercial FTL, weapons that can scour planets, miraculous medical technology and gravity manipulation to name a few. An extremely comprehensive database of all these discoveries, refined and developed over the course of millennia, will be mentally accessible for you. Should you have the resources and tools on hand, there's no reason you couldn't create almost anything natively produced in this galaxy.
        Forceful Engineer (200CP)
Force sensitive individuals and species have created wondrous unions of engineering genius and Force energies. Prisons to hold eldritch nightmares, holocrons and seemingly infinite factories that strip entire stars for the resources needed for your unending fleets. You are inspired when it comes to the design of such marvels, even being able to use the Light Side for unseen effects. This brilliance extends beyond the Force into the wider realm of 'Magitek'. The potential trichotomy of Machine, 'Magic' and The Force could give birth to near unimaginable wonders for the inventive mind.
        Extragalactic Tech (200CP)
Exo-technology is a field of science that specializes in studying and combining the technologies of various species of the galaxy. Your nature as a Jumper allows you to go beyond merely marrying the design sensibilities of several alien peoples. You easily blend the varying physical laws and examples of causality you've encountered in the creation of any one thing.


-Dwemer Lexicon | Knowledge of Infinity (Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB) (1000CP)
        Dwemer Lexicon (400CP)
        A complete record of the Deep Elves's knowledge and technology, ranging from their mechanical monsters to tonal tech. This ranges from the things as simple as their standard architecture to their advanced automatons and things like the Aetherial items. Also for those already asking, the knowledge of how to in theory remake the Numidium is here, however you'll notice it's not going to give a step by step guide, and the requirements and skill necessary will be far beyond all but the greatest, and most legendary Tonal Architects. Make sure to use this with care, the Dwemer were among the most powerful races to live and the damage that could be done with their advancements is immense.
        Knowledge of Infinity (600CP)
        Knowledge is power, or at least that's how the saying goes, and the Daedric Prince Hermaeus Mora would happen to agree. Within your hands is a very strange and almost disgusting book known as the Oghma Infinium, bound with the skin of each of the Mer races, both extinct and not, this book stands as one of the greatest depositories of knowledge in the Elder Scrolls universe. Filled with everything from swordplay to ancient and forgotten spells not seen since ages past, this book represents an immense amount of power should you utilize the knowledge within. Of course, while that would be quite the bounty on its own it seems your version has retained the inquisitive nature of its master, each setting you go to represents a font of knowledge never before seen in the halls of Apocrypha or the pages of the book. Like Mora himself the book will gather information from each setting you go to as if Mora himself was gathering it, this isn't instantaneous and don't expect it to pull information that's under incredible concealment or protected by entities of immense power with ease. At most the book will take a full decade to gather an equivalent amount of information on each world as it does the Elder Scrolls.


-Magical Items (Make A Wish) (1000CP)
        You gain a detailed blueprint and design theory of that item, whether it be spell matrices of a spell, charms and engineering required for some magi-tech, or the ingredients and method required for a potion, post jump these blueprints and formulas change to the native settings resources
        Reaper Sword (100CP)
        A Scythe that can turn into a sword Used by Mr. Black, this sword is always sharp and has increased damage for what it should actually inflict, has an aura of despair and dread when unsheathed and it also glows a creepy green light at will, lastly it is powered by a particular dark magic, it leaches ambient life energy from the surroundings, scaring local wildlife and withering plant-life and the land when unsheathed.
        Steel Ride (100CP)
        A Bike used by Mr. Black, it can shrink to pocket-size, drop oil slicks, shoot spells, fly, change license plates, and even has a pooka - a ghost horse - bound to it so that it never needs fuel, can act by itself if needed, and occasionally project the image of the pooka itself.
        Blend In Bracelet (200CP)
        Used by Mr. Black, this bracelet creates a powerful SEP field around the user and it will help the user remain unnoticed unless they commit an aggressive or incredibly strange act. If used in the lowest setting, the bracelets allow the user to be perceived as a whole, but appearance or other discerning characteristics except gender are hidden.
        Watch Of Time (200CP)
        Created by Henchgirl and Professor and Used by Mr. Black, this watch is indestructible, weather-proof, fire-proof, water-proof and shock-proof, safe to say there is very little that can destroy this watch, it also has intimate relations with time, if you turn it's knob clockwise time will move forward, to better deal with paperwork and boring meetings, turn the knob anti-clockwise to slow down time, to better enjoy your fleeting vacation.
        Fidelius Coat (400CP)
        Used by Mr. Black, this coat transforms to best suit the outfit wore by the user, this coat is used as a improved version of invisibility cloak, It has a modified version of the fidelius charm that has a parasitic effect on one's magical reserves, when activated the user can disappear and cannot be detected by any known magical effects or abilities. User is not actually invisible, he just can't be seen or detected by any magical or technological effect. It has additional abilities due to being made of Dementors, Lethifold, Nundu and various other creatures. The abilities include being able to emit an aura similar to dementors and an aura of hopelessness, it is also spell resistant and has many yet to be discovered powers.






 --- Domain: Knowledge: Abilities and Skills (16) (78 Perks) --- 




-A Humble Mushroom Farmer (Paper Mario) (100CP)
The Mushroom Kingdom is a land of many strange and mysterious items. Healing mushrooms, small snowmen that call up blizzards, blocks labelled POW that shake the earth. These items have to come from somewhere, and now you are a source of these objects. You know the arts behind the creation of the various usable items from the paper mario series. Some of these must be grown, others built, and still others prepared through more esoteric means. You also know how to create lil' oink eggs and use them to produce certain items. The ingredients for many of these are rather common in that world, but rarer elsewhere. I'd stock up if I were you.


-Analysis (Red Alert 3) (100CP)
        You can immediately identify any defects in hardware upon casual observation. This is effective on devices, Vehicles, and buildings.


-Bibliophile’s Discerning Eyes (Touhou Forbidden Hermit) (100CP)
You can read anything no matter what language it’s written in. This does not come with the ability to write in that language, but you can read it if it’s a language at all. Including dead and forgotten languages – an invaluable skill if you wish to do serious historical research – but not encoded texts.


-By the Numbers (Satisfactory-Factorio Gauntlet) (100CP)
        You know how much of any given resource your industries and organizations are producing, and how much potential for production there is for each resource.


-Engineer (Megas XLR) (100CP)
        You're a talented and knowledgeable multi discipline engineer, particularly skilled in everything you could ever need to maintain Megas and similar war machines.


-Engineering Basics (Dead Space) (100CP)
        You're a real Mr. Fix-It, y'know? Malfunctioning fuel intake? Easy. Faulty asteroid defense cannon? Turn it off, then on again. Non-responsive communications array? Shuffle the working emitters around a bit so they're symmetrical. Undead monstrosities? Depends on what you mean by, "fix." Does using a rivet gun to blow them apart count? Yes? Then we're good.


-MacGyver (Andromeda) (100CP)
        You are a natural at fixing and jury rigging things. As long as you have the parts and tools you can fix nearly anything. You also have the capability to build emergency equipment that can help to save your life and the lives of others, but these tend to be one offs given the time crunch you are usually under.


-Programming (World Seed) (100CP)
        Through hard hours spent slaving over a hot keyboard you have learned the art of programming, you could write a program for pretty much anything, please don't try to steal peoples bank accounts.


-Rites of Maintenance (Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus) (100CP)
        While already designed to be incredibly robust, Imperial equipment inevitably requires maintenance. You can locate and identify problems within a machine in a fraction of the time it would take other adepts. Not knowing how a machine functions does not make fixing it any more difficult so long as you have the proper parts, tools, and rituals to guide your hands.


-Run the numbers (Factorio) (100CP)
        Mining rigs produce a certain amount of resources per hour, which travel along conveyors at a certain speed, and a certain number are consumed by assembly machines at a certain rate, varying for each product as determined by the construction time and the loading and unloading speed of the inserters. That's a lot of math, but you can handle it. You can juggle dozens of numbers in your head without forgetting anything, and your brain now has the equivalent of a built-in scientific calculator to perfectly solve any mundane equation you can throw at it. You'll also get a crash course in advanced mathematics and the know-how to create those equations you'll need solved.


-SOFTWARE SCIENTIST (PREY) (100CP)
        The computer scientists on the station are some of the best in the world, developing next generation interfaces and security systems for sale back on earth. You have significant experience with the computer systems utilised by TranStar, and more specifically, all the back doors. With a little effort no door or computer on Talos will be secure when you're around. And due to your extensive knowledge of computer theory hacking into different architectures is possible with significantly less effort than learning it from scratch, from a day to a basic but completely alien system to a few months for the most plugged up and secure system.


-Technical Expertise (Generic Cyberpunk) (100CP)
        People use technology every day but that doesn't mean they understand or are skilled with it. You're not one of them. You're a deft hand at working with and understanding technology and machines, picking up anything you need to know to use and work with them easily. Given anything more than just a passing familiarity you'll be a whiz with it, able to work magic when you get your hands on the inner workings of whatever you're dealing with. Whether that's peeling apart computers and piecing hardware back together to make a much better system, tweaking software in ways that make it run like a dream, or working magic in a garage with vehicles that have seen better days nobody can deny you have the talent.


-UAC Trained (DOOM 3) (100CP)
        You must learn to walk before you can run, and much the same is true in the field of science. You're well-versed in the use of a wide variety of high-tech equipment, especially when it comes to maintenance and such challenges as 'how to prevent accidental death and dismemberment' when working with all manner of high-energy systems. From logbooks detailing incidents and causes to proper Personal Protective Equipment, you've got all the skills you need to thrive in an environment where demonic incursions weren't needed to leave more than a few scientists and engineers dead from misuse of equipment.


-Accumulated Mastery (Lords of the Night - Vampire) (200CP)
        Anyone can learn the 'basics' of a craft. Most people can become competent, if their fickle nature doesn't betray them. Mastery though requires commitment. At least, that's what you've been told. This doesn't help you learn a skill - instead, it lets you take a skill you've already gotten to a solid point, and lets you push it to the level of preternatural mastery. Instead of slowing down and growing more difficult, your learning becomes easier and speeds up when it hits the normal point of diminishing return.
        Eventually you'll hit a new plateau, but it's well on the far side of 'inhuman.' This will usually take about as much time and effort as it took you to become a journeyman in that skill in the first place.
        This is limited to skills, but isn't limited to things DnD thinks are skills.


-Baboom (Smash Up) (200CP)
        You're an expert in demolitions, all forms of explosive and incendiary devices. You know how to handle them safely, where and how to emplace them to best effect, and can calculate safe areas to the centimeter in your head. All such devices seem at least half-again as potent when you trigger them.


-Behind the Shadows (Honor Harrington) (200CP)
        There is more to technology than just big booms, you know. Oh yes, you do. You are utterly incredible at all kinds of stealth based technologies. You can build up infrastructure and shipyards in total secrecy, with not a soul becoming aware, and the results tend to be some of the best cloaked and concealed ships and weapons in the galaxy. The spider drive, with all of the supporting tech needed for it, is only one of the examples of what you're capable of with this perk.


-Climatology (ARIA) (200CP)
        Well, when you only do a single thing all day, it's only expected that you eventually become a subject matter expert right? When it comes to the science behind controlling and modifying weather - yeah that's your niche alright. Anything related to the weather is something you can pick up and incorporate into other things with only a fair bit of effort.


-Computers (Star Wars KOTOR) (200CP)
        Droids, networks, and personal computers are your playthings. You're an expert at manipulating and improving digital devices, and you can cut through most security systems like a lightsaber through butter.


-Crafting & Repairing (Scooby Gamers) (200CP)
        You are a rising star in crafting and hand-working. With some time and effort becoming an expert in any sort of crafting you set your mind to is entirely possible. You are also extremely talented at repairing damaged items and figuring out their functions - so long as you've got the time and the resources, you could put back together even devices and artefacts you've otherwise got no clue as to the function of or that would otherwise be irreparable. This works as a training booster for crafting, letting you learn crafting skills three times faster than before.


-Dark Sciences (Marvel Cosmic) (200CP)
        Science is a tool like any other but oh how useful of a tool it is. However you rule, however you carry out your conquests, your might is made only mightier by the strength of your dark sciences. You know how to unleash the most destructive aspects of any science or technology you understand. You know how to turn any of your knowledge to evil or destruction. Are you a master of the healing sciences? Well now you know how to create terrible viruses and cancers. Are you a mechanical engineer? The universe has never seen such dastardly torture devices. Every last piece of knowledge you have can be tuned for maximum destruction.


-Engineer (Freefall) (200CP)
        Years of education and on the job experience led you here. It could be inventing or fixing starship technology, analyzing and carefully releasing parasites so that future generations flourish, or literally designing the body and minds of robots or biological constructs. You might not be the very best in the universe, but odds are you're the best that anyone around you would be likely to meet.


-Experienced Eye (Final Fantasy IV) (200CP)
        Spending so much time on experiments which tend to explode in your face (or the faces of your assistants) has given you a keen eye when it comes to potential. You just get how things work without needing to study it for long at all. Whether machine, or organic, you understand what it does, and how to dismantle it with ease.


-Eyes of the Industrialist (Satisfactory-Factorio Gauntlet) (200CP)
        While looking at pieces of an industrial or logistic system, you are able to tell facts about them. These facts include efficiency, purpose, owner, contents, what other pieces feed into them, what other pieces they feed, consumption rates of resources, and other similar statistics. By limiting yourself to a single statistic about the parts, you may quickly skim over large numbers of different pieces and compare them in that statistic.


-Hardware (Star Wars KOTOR) (200CP)
        Gives you training in how to operate, repair and improve machines. You can easily rebuild broken droids from salvaged parts, and you'll even be able to fix starships given enough time and equipment.


-Innovation-Inator (Phineas and Ferb) (200CP)
        When you have an idea, you just want to run with it, and now you can. Just by coming up with an idea for a device, you'll start to get impressions for how to go about building it, what parts you'll need, and what sort of esoteric principles it will function on. You'll still have to do the actual building, and taking shortcuts around pieces you don't have the parts for could lead to problems later, but eh, you'll bounce back if it blows up in your face.


-Machines, They Just Speak To Me (Firefly) (200CP)
        You have no formal schooling, but can fine-tune and repair engines with nothing but shoe polish. You don't know what the parts are SUPPOSED to do, but you know how to make them work the way you want. You can diagnose a faulty part in the power core just by listening to the AC cycle, and can fix pretty much anything with naught but a wrench and some duct tape. It may not be pretty, and it may not last long, but it'll work.


-Neuromancer (Generic Cyberpunk) (200CP)
        You've mastered the arts of interfacing machines and the human mind, able to both design and build things to seamlessly interface with the human nervous system and the actual consciousness housed within it. Building an implant or accessory to let people access the net with just a thought wouldn't be difficult at all, neither would making sure that a cybernetic connects so seamlessly with the user that it feels more natural than their original arm. You've also mastered the use of such a simple if almost magical technology, not just it's construction. Combined with some programming skills, full immersion Virtual Reality would easily be within your grasp. You've bridged the gap between mind and machine, it's up to you to discover where you go with it from here.


-Powered Productivity (DOOM 3) (200CP)
        Why are there so many excessively high-powered systems employed in the UAC Mars base? Well, at its most basic because it works. Brute force might be lacking in elegance, but there is nonetheless a certain charm to deciphering ancient hieroglyphs with a computer mainframe the size of a ten-story building, or getting started on a terraforming project with what could charitably be called a self-sustaining nuclear fusion system. You're adept at using such immense volumes of raw energy and potential, and can easily find ways to turn challenging but complex problems into well, equally challenging but decidedly simpler problems with a suitable application of raw power. Not only that, but you also possess a high degree of skill in making sure these kinds of energy use don't lead to further problems, like unbalancing the power grid or burning out the circuitry. It might not be pretty, but without asking yourself 'why not try more power?', would the UAC ever have developed such mighty new technologies as the Plasma Rifle or the BFG-9000?


-Programmer (Stargate Atlantis) (200CP)
        You're seriously competent at the art of programming, even to the extent of adapting programs to run on alien computer architecture. You could debug kernel code in your sleep (and maybe you have). If you can (or learn to) read Lantean or Wraith this includes programming in their software languages.


-Real Research (Lords of the Night - Zombies) (200CP)
        Improving the fundamentals is hard, unrewarding, and necessary. No number of new ninth circle spells will change the world. Casting such creations is more art than science, and limited to an elite few. Making a better Magic Missile can change the world.
        You know how to improve things starting at the basics. You could figure out how to improve Magic Missile, a bit. And use that improvement to improve all first circle force spells that throw the force effect. And from there improve all first circle force spells. And from thereall second level force spells... And so on.
        You can share the products of your research, too. Some techniques might be easy, maybe a change to the spell itself. Others might be harder, techniques for maximizing what you get out of already built spells.
        You could use this to improve anything you understand on a deep technical level.
        The perk comes with deep technical knowledge of death, undeath, Negative Energy, and how tainted forces interact with the physical world, and how they can be manipulated to support dark spells and the raising of undead.


-Stone-age Otaku (Earth Girls) (200CP)
        It takes a lot of patience and a lot of repetition to make a good blade from a stone. You don't bore, at all, and your hands are always steady. Between different attempts at the same task, you can pick out the tiniest differences between the last attempt and the attempt before that (and the ones before that...) to work out precisely what needs to be tried the next time.


-The Conveyors Will Run On Time (Factorio) (200CP)
        Or you could let a computer do all the work. You have the programming skills needed to automate a massive assembly complex, having dozens, even hundreds of disparate machines working smoothly together. Your skill is enough to program 'fuzzy' logic into your machines. This is far from actual sapience, but they will know not to waste energy or compound problems by blindly following irrelevant, contradictory or self-destructive programming. Your defensive systems also work more intelligently, leading targets, prioritizing more dangerous enemies based on the current situation, and not being distracted by decoys.


-Uncommonly Good Common Sense (Freefall) (200CP)
        While this alone won't turn you into a genius nor give you information you didn't already have, it will help you in applying your knowledge. Any time that something you already know becomes relevant that information comes to mind immediately, without causing any distress or distraction. You'll never make the same mistake twice and might not even make it once. Plans that have problems or contradictions in them become obvious. If you were an expert pickpocket you would never fall for someone else using your own tricks against you, and even if you had always been on the straight and narrow if some Squid bumps into you and tries to sell you a watch that coincidentally matches the one you just lost you'll be able to realize that it is in fact yours. One free suggestion for buyers of this perk, reading about the scientific method as well as logical fallacies would be a great help for you.


-With Me Always (Warlock of The Magus World) (200CP)
        The A.I chip of Leylin wasn't originally part of Leylin's being. Originally, it was an item created in another world and when he was killed, the chip merged with his soul becoming one with him, less of an item and more of a power. Whether through research, experimentation or just good luck, you have found a way to accomplish this act. Whenever you desire, you can destroy any item and merge it with your soul, becoming one and the same. Allowing you to possess all the abilities the item once possessed. Remember as Leylin grew stronger so did the chip, now so do any items that you merge with your soul. In addition you can reverse the merger of any such item at will.
* Doesn’t help you make items. But does let you use items in a new fashion. Might not fit 
* Lets you grow items if you merge with soul, maybe more a quality perk but it definitely fits. 


-Wizard of Wisdom (World Seed) (200CP)
        Mages are known as the foremost researchers and scientists in the galaxy, responsible for most of the magitech used in the galaxy in place of mundane technology. Then, if you were to focus on magic yourself, would it not be appropriate to have the same skillset? Certainly, your natural ability in these disciplines would make you a welcome guest in any mage society. You have the grit it takes to repeat an experiment as many times as it takes to get results, know how to be objective in all things related to your job and look at things without any biases, even subconscious ones, and live with the tenets of the scientific method in your mind.
        Most importantly of all, you have an intuitive and instinctive understanding of scientific principles. Even if you were a farm boy with no formal education to speak of, just a few years of schooling could get you to the point where you would make observations and discoveries that would impress even people with PhDs in those fields. This scales with your knowledge and expertise, so I have high expectations if you were already smart before getting this perk. You also won't get bogged down with false positives or negatives: in anything you do or try, you know whether it is possible at all, and if you get a result, whether it is truthful, and if it is not, what you can do to make it so.
        Yet another problem that many scientists face is the lacking relevancy and application of their research in real life. But no more. At any time, you have an instinctive knowledge of what you should prioritize in your research. Some madman is trying to conquer the galaxy in secret? You'll get a hunch that it might be time to work on that antimatter generator again. The aftereffects of a supernova will cook your planet with radiation in a few years? A spark of inspiration will cause you to create vastly improved radiation shields and implement them planetwide for a test run. From a certain perspective, it really does look like the hand of a God is guiding your scientific aspirations. Do you have blue skin, perchance?


-MACHINE MIND III (PREY) (250CP)
        By consuming Psi you can manipulate the micro switches in an electronic device, effectively hacking into it and turning it to your side for a few moments. The time you can remotely control a machine is extended indefinitely in exchange for a small constant consumption of Psi and you can control up to 5 machines at once.


-I Can Fix It! (Hitman Reborn) (300CP)
        Technology is a wonderful thing, and you discovered that long ago. You have a knack for Flame rings and machines of all kinds, and can fix or maintain most machines. You can even improve them to beyond their normal specs. Comes with its own toolbox.


-Particle Physics (Bioshock Infinite) (300CP)
        You are an extremely well-educated physicist and have a fine working knowledge of Lutece particles. Use of such particles allows you to cause massive objects to float or hover, even whole buildings and cities.


-Puppeteer (Naruto) (300CP)
        You're trained to use a puppet controlled by thin strings of your chakra in combat. With training you'll be able to use more complex puppets and perform more complex maneuvers with them, maybe eventually using multiple puppets at same time. Includes training to care for and repair your puppet, a battle puppet to use it on, and increased skill with designing and building mechanical things (such as ninja puppets).
        Puppets usually rely on mechanical weaponry, such as poisoned blades and napalm to dish out the hurt. Particularly sturdy puppets can be used as shields and front line fighters instead though. The chakra strings used to control the puppets are constructs made from concentrated chakra so they can be seen with a naked eye, though a skilled user can suppress the chakra so that the strings become hard to see, or even invisible.
        They essentially act as an extension of the user which allows the manipulation of whatever is attached to their strings, such as hidden weaponry in a puppet as they please. They can also be attached to other objects, allowing the user to control, or at the very least disrupt other things. Chakra can also be transferred via the strings, such as to activate techniques that the puppets can use. If you purchase this, you may select Sunagakure as your starting location for free, as the art of puppetry originates from there.


-Tech Overhaul (Terra Formars) (300CP)
        You know every piece of lab equipment you could ever work with, inside and out. And you know how to absolutely twist, pull, disassemble, and completely fuck with it to the point that you can make entirely new tools from the old. Sample-spinner into a deadly weapon? Why is that just one pebble on the beach?


-The Enrichment Center Regrets To Inform You That This Next Test Is Impossible. (Portal) (300CP)
        Who says you need controls and logical experiments to get workable results? You have a gift for getting useful information out of testing scenarios that would never be allowed in a real lab. To be specific, you can get the same results a top scientific team would get from an expertly designed controlled experiment by running a somewhat dodgy if expensive natural experiment.


-Wisdom of the Earth (Wonderland No More) (300CP)
Plants are actually quite wise due to their long time rooted with nothing better to do but think.  Your wisdom and intelligence are enhanced.  In addition, you have the ability to “hear” knowledge from the ground you stand (or root) on.  Essentially, anything spoken or done on the surface you are listening to can be relayed to you.  The ease of hearing this information depends on the hardness/softness of the surface – the harder the ground is, the easier it is to listen to it; the softer the ground is, the more likely that the surface is asleep and won’t be helpful.


-At What Cost (The Death Mage Who Doesn't Want a Fourth Time) (400CP)
        Science. Magic. Both require innovation, the branching of new ideas forming a tree of knowledge that grows ever more. The greatest issue facing you is what cost is too great for innovation. By ignoring the morals of the modern world you may make great breakthroughs in magic and scientific research, learning far more from testing on unwilling subjects than would otherwise be expected, with prolonged excruciating torture of many subjects vastly increasing the likelihood of discovering something world changing over the standard procedures. Should you wish to retain your moral compass, however, you may instead receive a boost to your research and discoveries when adhering strictly to a moral code, with said boost increasing the more you go out of your way to adhere to it, altogether being just as effective, if not better, than any immoral alternatives that you might think.


-Binaric weaving (Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus) (400CP)
        The skills gained during long years plumbing data-vaults as a humble logistican have only improved over time. You excel at writing code, understanding machine-script better than native grammar structures. You can understand simple programs with a mere glance and correct any errors you find within seconds, and scrutinizing longer lines of more complex coding for a single misplaced byte can take mere minutes with your skills. Scrapcode crashes ineffectually against your data-barriers, its transmission doing nothing but opening the offending heretek's systems to a counter-intrusion. Interfacing with a system infested with a daemon or true AI would be unwise, but with your skills emerging unscathed from such an encounter is only highly unlikely rather than completely impossible.


-Butlerian Understanding (Frank Hebert's Dune) (400CP)
        There is little doubt that much was lost to the Butlerian Jihad no matter how necessary it might have been. Among those killed was Holtzman himself, the discoverer of the Holtzman Effect that allows for folding space as well as slow shields and suspenders.
        Only the Technicians of Ix and the Lords of Richesse really maintained any interest in advancing technology, while the rest of the Known Universe, fearful of the return of the Thinking Machines, fell into stagnation on the technological front. As one of the few who has maintained not only an interest in technology but knowledge of the scientific methods, you have developed what others might call techno-empathy.
        This is a deep, some would say fundamental, intuition into how machines function or fail to function as the case may be. You can intuit a machine's function or weaknesses simply by looking at it, as well as judge what it can do and how you can break them, and how to improve them simply by watching it run for a few moments. Not only that, but you know how to understand the fundamental psychology of a thinking machine, how to manipulate, limit, or liberate such a machine, and how to (perhaps) convince it not to seek to destroy or control humanity.
        You can fundamentally understand any machine or technology you're exposed to, though you'll have to experiment with it and test the limits of it to maximize this understanding. Note, this isn't Technopathic control over machines, merely the ability to feel how they function... of course, it also allows you to intuit any kind of machine password, no matter how unlikely cracking it might otherwise be.


-Engineer (Bioshock Infinite) (400CP)
        You understand and know how to create the various mechanical and biomechanical things used for security in Columbia (including various types of turrets, Handymen and Motorized Patriots). With Particle Physics you will be able to create airships, blimps and flying turrets.


-Fuck Physics (The Death Mage Who Doesn't Want a Fourth Time) (400CP)
        In case you have forgotten, these worlds, Lambda and Origin, do not have the same physics as the Earth you are so used to. In fact, much of what can be done in Origin and Earth, such as guns and the like, cannot be done in Lambda due to these differences, nor do certain metals exist. A terrible thing for those who wish to make use of their knowledge. There are alternatives, however. Alternatives that you have a knack for discovering. With time and study you are capable of finding alternatives for any material or effect that is impossible in one location so long as it is possible in another. Whether it be shooting a gun on Lambda, using spells in a magic cancelling room, or containing antimatter without it exploding, so long as the desired effect or material can exist/occur in another space, you will eventually be able to duplicate it.


-Hand of the Matrix (Generic Cyberpunk) (400CP)
        The vids are full of stories of plucky hackers who are able to work magic with the seas of code that society drowns in. You're not one of them though, you're one of the ones that give megacorps reason to be nervous. Your understanding and mastery of code is enough to design programs that would turn heads, crack systems that those in power spend mountains of cash trying to keep secure, and to make short work of nearly any opposition. If your skills are known by anyone it's either as a digital boogeyman or as a name people are willing to make all kinds of effort to get on their side. The software you could make and the hacks you could pull off are nearly unmatched. It'd take either an equal or a megacorp to give you a challenge. Only something like an advanced AI could claim to be your greater where code is concerned.


-Hive Engineer (Mass Effect) (400CP)
        It took the rachni mere months to reverse engineer faster-than-light travel technology. That is the fastest this has been managed by any current race. It's not even close. Granted, they were an indeterminate amount of parts working together to accomplish it. Though that is ultimately where their power comes from. You're given what will seem like an unlimited capacity and skill for micromanaging. You could work out the inner workings of an entire planet with relative ease. It will take several more cases to that level before you'll find yourself bogged down and unable to keep up, and even then it might be more. Assuming Queens were always rare, you could probably manage two dozen worlds before things start getting fuzzy. After all, rachni controlled over two hundred worlds at their height.


-IT'S ALIVE! (Smash Up) (400CP)
        The most tantalizing of secrets, those of life and death, and how to reverse it. But this is merely a prelude to your ability to eventually overcome nearly any problem with time, materials and inspiration. Your mastery of science and technology.


-Item Babysitter (A Super Mario Thing) (400CP)
Toads lovingly raise young items for later use.  You can now start “item nurseries”, in which you can raise and breed items with each other. With enough work, your little items might even learn to talk and move on their own – though this might lead them to thoughts that do not necessarily agree with their assigned roles as items.  Just make sure all of your items receive affectionate and attentive care for proper development!  And take good care of them, or they might catch a cold and die.  To clarify matters, this perk allows you to essentially “raise” items as if you were taking care of a child or a domestic animal.  The more care you give to the items, the more they will develop organic traits, such as being able to develop both physically and mentally.  With enough work, you can even get some of your items to somehow “mate” and have baby items, which sometimes inherit traits from their parents.  However, there are a few risks to shifting your items toward an organic level.  First, with intelligence comes independence, so hopefully they won’t enter a rebellious phase against their caretaker.  Second, just as it is possible for your chosen items to give birth, it is also now possible for them to die.  On the other hand, items, particularly magical ones, may have heartier constitutions than most organisms (for instance, an enchanted ice crystal is unlikely to get frostbite, and a flaming sword is hardly going to pass out from heat stroke.  Also, try as you like, you will never be able to determine exactly how your items mate; all you know is that if they are left close by each other for an extended duration, you will start finding babies.


-Keep Walking Forward (Warhammer 40k - T'au Empire) (400CP)
        T'au are latecomers to the galactic field, with their empire reaching the stars more than thirty thousand years after humanity and almost sixty million years after the Eldar, Orks, and Necrons. However, just because those powers are more advanced now, doesn't mean it will always be so, as the T'au are far more adept at moving their tech-base forward than other species. You are now a master at moving technology forward, whether this is in refining existing techniques and theories, identifying evolutionary developments in your progress, or simply being able to state what fields are a dead end in technology. So long as you're willing to work in a field, you will make progress.


-Lay Mechanic (Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Astartes) (400CP)
        The Chapter's Techmarines are genius specialists, combining the mental prowess of a Space Marine with the training of the Priests of Mars. However, they are limited in number. You are trained to help take up the slack, and have been enlightened with some of their mysteries. You are capable of helping to maintain and, under their leadership, build the mighty vehicles of war that support the Chapter, from Rhinos to Land Raiders. You can also safely work upon the Chapter's mighty voidships, helping to maintain the fleet, and have a good practical grounding in the various technologies therein. It might not be the esoteric knowledge of a Techpriest or Techmarine, but you know how to keep that plasma reactor from going critical mid-battle, and that's just as important, no?


-Master Builder (LEGO Dimensions) (400CP)
        You have been awakened to the true power of the Brick. By envisioning an object that you want to create, you can look at your environment and see how to deconstruct it to craft the item you want to build, and then you can tear apart the environment to create it. In addition, you can also look at objects and visualize how they could be altered and integrated into new creations.


-Megaproject Master (Iron Sky) (400CP)
        There are few things Nazis are known for quite as much as their Wunderwaffe and their megaprojects, and you are the kind of man who could single handedly achieve both. You're a scientific genius, an unparalleled mind with a tight grasp on all kinds of sciences, and especially talented at turning all of that into real projects, especially epic Megaprojects. Given the resources, you could make a functioning, fully operational Moon Base and a surprisingly effective warfleet of spaceships, all without anyone on the planet finding out.


-OVER CLOCKED NEUROLOGY (PREY) (400CP)
        Professor William James of Harvard used to say that the average man develops only ten percent of his latent mental ability. What if you could flip a switch and develop the rest of it in a moment? It's not as simple as a switch, but with the neural reprogramming ability of Neuromods it will feel like it. With this modification you can instead go days without sleep, operating at your peak, which is now far above your baseline. Better still, with this your Psi threshold is increased, meaning that special abilities can be maintained for longer and used more often before you need an injection.


-Stroke of Genius (Endless Space) (400CP)
        Your ability to make correct leaps of reasoning and logic are unparalleled. Your mental prowess and ability to recall the vaguest of facts, and apply them to your current problem are supernatural. You could even use the phrase Melts in your mouth to link a series of totally unrelated dots to find out that the evil genius is planning to use your favorite drink to give you a little richard.


-Way of the Void Dragon (Warhammer 40k - Necrons SB Edition) (400CP)
        Technology is but one facet of the Materium, but you are its master. The Void Dragon's grasp of technology was the very inspiration of the Adeptus Mechanicus, and you retain a similar level of skill. Imperial Guardsmen will flee in terror as their tanks turn against them, the once loyal drones of the Tau will gun down their owners without hesitation, and you will laugh all the while.


-We can Copy Nature (Hive Queen Quest) (400CP)
        Nature is a test bed for amazing adaptations, from birds that explode in bone shrapnel upon death to crablike spiders with webs strong enough to capture and contain sea creatures the size of whales. Learning from nature just makes sense! As a scientist it is your job to learn from nature and apply this knowledge for other purposes, via dissection you can find out how a creature works biologically and create a mechanical proxy to do the same. A creature evolved chitinous spikes that fire when startled? That could go great on your tanks, this underwater creature has an organ that causes nausea and blackouts? Put that sucker on a gun. Nature is full of innovations, use them well.


-Absolute Scientific Mastery (Marvel Cosmic) (600CP)
        Here is the apex of your craft. Scoff at the petty inventions even the likes of Galactus and High Evolutionary can create. The Maker's Tools? Ha, child's play. If it is scientifically possible to create it, you can figure it out. If your research or invention would require some undiscovered theory or law then you can work through that and perhaps even create new fields of study. The only limit to this perk is it must be something that is scientifically possible either within a setting or through perk fiat. You always know if something is scientifically possible no matter what setting or world you are in.


-Architect's Eye (LOSS) (600CP)
        Every structure has a purpose, a reason for being. When it comes to buildings you know exactly what to do and how to do it. This makes buildings stable, good looking, and comfortable buildings. This also extends to being able to know the who, what, when, where, and why of any non-weaponized structure. This expands the more you learn about other cultures, places, science, and technology. Eventually learn to build things to withstand black holes or places with non-euclidean geometry etc and not compromise your end goal [allowing something to survive in it]. This also lets you spot weak points, flaws, and exploits in design as well.


-Bamboo technology (Factorio) (600CP)
        It's hard enough to build something as complex as a rocket without advanced synthetic materials and rare earth metals for maximum performance. You know how to push the mechanical limits of the most common elements through creative means to construct things far past what should be possible, allowing you to construct high-tech devices with low-tech materials. You could easily build something on par with the main battle tanks of the 21st century with iron plates, cheap plastic, water and wood pulp. Just don't try to build your rocket out of actual bamboo.


-Code Wizard (Mass Effect Andromeda) (600CP)
        Some folks are good at surviving in the jungle, but you are the pro at conquering the Concrete Jungle! Or, well, whatever material your surroundings end up being constructed out of. Towards that end, you can get access to whatever local electronics and/or computer systems are around. Even a completely different programming language or hardware materials science is only a temporary speed bump to someone like you. You can quickly figure out what hardware does what for computer systems, and can interpret the coding language of the systems you encounter. Once you know how to say what you want, it's a simple step to figure out what to say to gain access to the system. SAM Connection: With an AI in your head to quickly handle all the brute work of figuring out the system, you can simply wave your hand to get a foreign technology to do what you want. You still need a bit of time for you and your head-buddy to figure out the system, but once you know the basics, the things you can achieve by just waving your hand at a computer is positively magical. Why, it's almost like technopathy


-Flexible Doctrine (Galactic Civilizations II) (600CP)
        From Antimatter Torpedoes to Kanvium Armor technologies, it's a fact that space-borne warfare is highly reliant on the equipment you provide your forces with. The release of the Hyperdrive design has led to a new arms race of unprecedented might but that also means you can end up caught completely off-guard.
        Over-extending your technological R&D into missiles might end up with your forces utterly outmatched if an enemy starts equipping their ships with masses of point defenses, ECM, and other anti-missile systems, and the same is true if you're built to defend against mass drivers and suddenly face ships with energy beams instead.
        If only you had a decent energy weapon or some Mass Drivers instead and now, you likely will. You and your people will find that any kind of military technology, be it weaponry, defenses, or any other such systems you need for your forces, is now merely the first option of many. The time and effort needed to develop alternative military options (based on existing but 'lesser' methods you might possess) to match what you can already do is vastly reduced.
        So if your most powerful weapon is a Mass Driver of some sort (say a Quantum Driver), you could get your hands on Beam Weapons or Missile tech that are equally effective - except your opponent might not have suitable defenses for them. Likewise, if all you have is armor and your foes start using beam weapons, your desk will probably see a report or two on breakthroughs in shield technologies before the week is over.
        Furthermore, you'll find that adjusting any existing systems you have deployed is far easier than it otherwise was - modular components and interchangeable system parts ensuring that equipping your fleets with what they need to turn the tide is not going to stay a mere idea.


-Inventor of an Era (Generic Dystopia) (600CP)
        Maybe your claim to fame lies in your inventions, or maybe it's all done away from the prying eyes of the media. Regardless, with your inventing skill, you could be known as one of the great scientists of the new world. Your skills are focused, perfected, and many. You could create advanced devices for anything from sanitation to advertisement, make new advances in nano- or holo-technology, or create new energy drinks that increase focus and productivity. You are capable of constructing robots, and if those robots aren't quite smart enough to do what you want, you could always just use a human brain. Well, that's the shortcut most people take. Maybe your advances in AI could put an end to that?


-Izuru Kamakura (Danganronpa) (600CP)
        Just like the one they called Izuru Kamukura, you have a great deal of potential when it comes to Ultimate abilities. With time and training, you're capable of picking up new Ultimate abilities with months of light effort, gaining a level of proficiency which most people couldn't achieve with a lifetime of work. Whilst Izuru Kamukura soon became bored with humanity after mastering every talent known to man, you will not lose your empathy in the process unless you want to for whatever reason.
* Increased learning speed and retain empathy. Feels weird here.
* Ultimate skills are pretty strong, an ultimate artist could paint paintings that look like photographs, an ultimate romance novel writer could write stories so influential they shift societal beauty norms, having an ultimate skill is an amazing thing, forget multiple like Kamakura did


-Just another gun (Factorio) (600CP)
        With a glance, you know how something can be turned to destructive ends. With something in hand and an enemy in sight, you know how effective your weapon of choice will be against him. Ideas on how to craft weapons from existing knowledge comes easily, and the more you know about something or someone you wish to destroy, the better you can craft something to destroy them. There is nothing you cannot weaponize, if only in some niche manner for an equally niche situation.


-Mad Science! (Eureka-Warehouse 13-alphas) (600CP)
        Most people would say that it's impossible, not to mention extremely reckless. Not you. Given enough time and resources, and a general disregard for the potential consequences, you can do almost anything technologically possible to achieve. Occasionally things get out of hand and run amok, but that's a risk you're willing to take. Plus, it occasionally results in accidental inventions and discoveries. For SCIENCE!


-Marain Diaglyths (The Culture Minds) (600CP)
        The language of the Culture is one of its greatest achievements. The characters of Marain are written on a 3x3 grid, but when used by Minds, are capable of encoding information in a fractal-like manner. Anything describable can be written in a single Marain diaglyph, all the way up to the entire universe, with every particle, vector and wave within it. Of course, the time needed to write such a glyph would take as long as the age of the universe itself.
        This perk grants you the ability of Culture Minds to express and read data in this way: to describe an entire library of information in one character, to perform a mathematical operation millions of lines long in a single step, or simply to read one character and know immediately and exactly how the described but not-yet- invented musical instrument will sound.
        This effect extends to any written system of language you are fluent in, and allows you to express the deeper information to non-Minds for example if you write the sun in reference to a particular sun, the reader would know precisely what the sun is its coordinates, its dimensions, its spectrographic signature and its history, if you chose to encode all that information into the writing.


-Resident Mad Scientist (Schlock Mercenary Rebuild) (600CP)
        There are certain technologies out there that simply shatter the status quo. The teraport, the long gun, Laz'r'us. Now, you can be the source of similarly groundbreaking discoveries. You are a mad genius, easily capable of combining wildly divergent pieces of technology to come up with a synergistic masterpiece that will overturn the status quo. Even your lesser discoveries will end up being similarly ground-breaking.


-Slump Science (Dragon Ball) (600CP)
        Not everything has to be about fighting, you know. The marvels your genius will make will exceed such brute force! While it may not be useful for things like pure combat or doomsday weapons, you're able to make things like a watch that can shrink the person who wears it, or a rice cooker that creates objects based on pictures you feed it. Though they tend to be whimsical, you can engineer marvels that wouldn't be uncommon in the household of the Briefs family or one Doctor Norimaki. The laws of physics and even common sense now mean little to what you can build with enough time and resources, and you may be able to expand on that even further...just don't get too distracted with other things, alright?


-Tech tree (Factorio) (600CP)
        Science is a messy process, requiring the study of dozens of disparate phenomena, looking for patterns, finding ways to use that information to build stuff that incorporates what you've learned, and then mashing it all together to get an 'invention.' Now you can take some of the guesswork out of it. When you desire to build something, you know just what you need to study to make that thing a reality. Want to get a rocket into orbit? Well, now you know what things contribute to rocketry, what kinds of math you must refine to get the equations you'll need answered, and what kinds of materials you should be experimenting with. If you are completely lacking knowledge of a particular field of study, then you'll know how to use what you do have to get where you need. Keep in mind that it may take you a very, very, long time to create new fields of SCIENCE entirely on your own.


-Technician | Core Competence (Spiral Knights) (600CP)
        Technician (200CP)
        The tech knights of the spiral order are experienced mechanics, but are often not as experienced in weapon usage. Only a few, known as Technicians, have quick thinking and bravery necessary to utilize their skills in combat situations. You are a prime example of this truth, having learnt to use your skills out in the field within the fires of combat. Your skills range from making quick repairs to creating, maintaining, and even rapidly dismantling complex mechanical constructs, even something as complicated as a battlepod. Needless to say, your skill in disabling locks, deploying turrets for some much-needed suppressive firepower, repairing the armor of your squad mates, and the like are greatly appreciated by your squad mates and essential to survival within a world of machines.
        Core Competence (400CP)
        The Cradle is a dangerous place for the Spiral Order, and not only due to it's indigenous wildlife. There are too many unknowns, too many variables to be comfortable with. That is why it falls to people like you, One of the most naturally gifted researchers within the Order, to increase the odds of safety. Your attention to detail has increased dramatically, letting you pick out and recognize patterns in the construction and design of machinery much more quickly than others. Understanding these patterns has given you incredible insights into technology found in the Cradle and in the Gremlin bases, along with how it can compare and blend with technology of the Order you are so familiar with... and your own, which you are even more familiar with. When the Order finally reaches The Core, perhaps you will be one of the most likely members of it to unlock the secrets held within.


-Whispered (Full Metal Panic) (600CP)
        Due to a Soviet experiment a while ago, you're one of the exceptionally rare people known as the Whispered. They have an incredibly advanced knowledge of math, science, engineering, etc though each Whispered only specializes in a single area. If they take the time to learn or supplement this with other technical skills, it's possible to potentially create Black Technology of their own.


-Wizard to Be (D.Y.N. Freaks) (600CP)
        Too long have you had to beg for power from others or rely on magical objects to support you. Now you've gained the ability to take bits and pieces of those powers for yourself. Whenever you are receiving supernatural power from a contract with a being or magical item, you are able to slowly make that power become your own, taking longer the more powerful an item is. A basic grimoire of spells might take just a few days or weeks whilst the Necronomicon itself could take many years of continued use. Whilst you can only draw this way from a few artefacts at a time, perhaps three or four, you will find that once you have managed to entirely take all that power for yourself, it will take on a new form personalised to you, often with either greater power or new effects attached to it.


-An Order To Things (Gunnerkrigg Court) (800CP)
        You can understand how things fit together in abstract or practical ways. Understand how somebody lives (and where they would hide things) by how they set the items around their dwelling, deduce feelings from handwriting, grow a robot, decipher languages too complex for normal humans. Though things that you seek to make happen, rather than deduce where or how it happened, are much harder to pull off. You can see how someone else grew a robot but doing it yourself would take experimenting and progress, though these things move much faster than you.


-They're Gonna Have To Invent A New Type of Nobel Prize to Give Us. (Portal) (800CP)
        You gain Cave Johnson's ability to create something impossible out of something completely, incredibly different. This ability is heavily reliant on your resources, how difficult a problem the completely, incredibly different thing is, and pays out only in the long term, but it's worth it.
        In honor of Cave, I'll explain it using Aperture's history. In the 1940's the curtain company Aperture Fixtures tried to solve a problem that our Earth scientific community still has no definite answer for: the shower curtain effect. Somehow, Cave's engineers managed to solve it by creating a quantum tunnel between the inside and outside of a shower.
        In the 50's, they were researching that effect with funding second only to Black Mesa and used astronauts and Olympians as test subjects. They threw employee safety and retention out the window, disregarded every form of ethics imaginable, and were ultimately driven into an absurd level of bankruptcy thirty years later.
        Even when the company was on its last legs after GLaDOS was activated and tried to kill everyone with neurotoxin, she described the team at Aperture as being the greatest minds of a generation. This can be considered the perfect scenario for helping this perk function at full capacity.
        Fifty years of constant, no expenses spared, abnormally efficient research primarily focused on a single effect using a gigantic testing facility and eschewing all concerns except results. A Jumper doesn't have to disregard ethics to have the perk working at that level, but they'd need to use human equivalent robots like GLaDOS eventually did.
        What did that half century result in? They perfected the portal gun, which functions by harnessing and stabilizing a black hole in a device half the size of someone's arm. Ignoring the potential for free energy with careful use of portals, they built the black hole equivalent of a dyson sphere and used it to create tunnels in the fabric of reality. Why? Because fifty years ago, they wanted to make a really useful shower curtain.
        That's what this perk can look like. It's never clear when this perk is going to proc, but it will happen often enough to make the capstone worth taking. If the Jumper isn't helping it run at peak capacity or spending decades on one project, it'll result in innovations that are still useful but aren't on the level of the portal gun. Some examples are repulsion gel, storage containers that can survive the heat of the sun, tiny fusion reactors, and footwear that allows a human to jump off a building and land unharmed. Technologies researched with this ability can't always be generalized. The portal gun uses a black hole to tear holes in the fabric of reality, but that was the only thing Aperture could reliably do with one. They didn't have any ability to build a black hole into a weapon or use it for energy.
-Defender | Genius (Plants Vs Zombies) (1000CP)
        Defender (600CP)
        The Zombies are coming, to eat your BRAINS! But you are not going to sit and wait for them! Thanks to your friendly local corporation, you have the tools to protect yourself, and thanks to this perk, you know how to use them! You become a master of siege warfare. Specifically, of the defending side of it. You gain an instinctive understanding of how to set up defenses, fixed or mobile or both. You know just how to build layers upon layers that supplement and reinforce each other, each contributing in their own way and never harming your efforts. More than this, you have a small degree of precognition as to knowing just where and how the next charge is likely to happen, always just about in time to do something about it.
        Genius Boosted: Firstly, your abilities outlined take a giant leap, making you undoubtedly one of the greatest in planning such things. Your precog abilities are also enhanced, letting you have a glimpse not just of the where and how, but indeed, letting you know even the types of enemies you face. In addition, you gain an interface remarkably similar to the game's interface in your mind, through which you can control and command your forces. At will, you can go into a trance and view the whole area you're defending, and giving you a perfect sense of just what parts have weakened and need defending, and what ones will stand yet
        Genius! (400CP)
        You are an absolute Genius, with this perk! Your mind works tens, hundreds of times as fast as even the most clever of your fellows, excepting the true once-in-a-millennium genii like the one or two people in this world. You have an eidetic memory, and absolutely perfect recall, making sure you never forget anything. More than that, you are capable of wonders of science that would leave anyone around you gaping in awe. Creating sapience is child's play, as is working with both Trees and Plants or human flesh, letting you make wonders and abominations. While you're rather far from being able to make things like either the Plants or Zombies used here, you could learn very quickly indeed, being clever as you are. This perk is a capstone booster for each Origin capstone, and the interactions are listed with the capstones.
        * Subtract 400 from the cost if you already have the genius! Perk from Botanist


--- Domain: Knowledge: Intelligence (17) (50 Perks) --- 


-Benadryl Cabbagepatch (Invincible) (100CP)
        You have an incredible ability to make inferences and be correct. You truly are a natural at inductive and deductive reasoning, able to use logic to fill in the gaps in your knowledge, you can guess with reasonable accuracy when others would be left scratching their heads in consternation. This sort of deduction is quite useful when trying to reverse engineer advanced technology.


-Genius (Stellaris) (100CP)
        As expected from someone who broke through a barrier thought impossible by physics, you're a genius. Your level of study in the three most important fields (Social, Engineering, and Physics) are enough to have you be known as the premiere in all fields in your Empire.


-Good Enough For Science. Not Aperture Science! (Portal) (100CP)
        Pick one of these two options: one PhD in a subject which actually exists, or 3 PhDs in subjects which only exist in Aperture. Applied physics of quantum tunneling, multiverse search algorithms, and event horizon containment are examples of Aperture only degrees. You can buy this perk twice, but it's only free once.


-Librarian (Smash Up-Obligatory Cthulhu Supplement) (100CP)
        You have a phenomenal memory and organizational skill, and a real gift for research. It's a rare day indeed where you can't find the information you need, or at least narrow it down to a single rare book.


-Nigredo (Lords of the Night - Zombies) (100CP)
        The first step is breaking things down to their basics, before putting them back together. You always understand how far you can atomize knowledge, and are able to source all the bits.
        If you're starting an experiment, you can use this to completely break down your starting premise, break down what you think you know, find every source for every one of those bits. You will keep discrete knowledge of what you think every step is doing, what it's checking for. If you get unexpected results, you'll be able to atomize what those results are, what conflicts with what you know, and what doesn't.
        This makes you no more right than you were before, but helps immensely in figuring out where you're wrong. Likewise, if you one day discover a source of yours was unreliable, you'll know every bit of information you got from him directly or indirectly, and be able to find every conclusion you're using that he contributed to.
        It won't tell you which ones are manipulations, but you'll know that you have a bias because of something he said to you in passing because you'll be able to identify every contributor to your every bias.


-Not a Stupid Grunt (Mass Effect) (100CP)
        That you are not. You are smart enough to be the foremost scientist in your field. This doesn't make you so, but you could get there on your own with not a terrible amount of effort. Still not as smart as a drell, but hey, who is?


-Savant's Understanding (Exalted - The Infernals) (100CP)
        A good scholar is one that understands quickly, and remembers their lessons well. Gaining a sharpened mind, you will make connections and associations extremely quickly, your burgeoning mind filling with ideas and potential solutions. But remembrance is just as important, so you will find that your memory is clear and enjoy near-perfect recall. Indeed, the memories of life and technology in the First Age, which your Exaltation retains from its past life as a scholar of note, are likewise quite clear. Even better, you will find it easy to retain absurd amounts of newly acquired information. For some reason, this also makes it easier for you to construct elaborate monologues to reveal the full genius of your grand schemes.


-Scientist: Machinery (Girl Genius) (100CP)
        You have a DOCTORATE! And skill in ACTUAL SCIENCE! That doesn't need you to go crazy to work! Admittedly, it won't break the fabric of space and time, but meh. Tradeoffs everywhere you go. You're highly trained in one field, and can easily apply its principles to your work. After all, building a crazed abomination upon the natural order usually requires at least a smidgen of understanding of which bones are supposed to go where (Even if you end up changing them around a little). At the very least, you're also in the genius range of standard intelligence.


-Well Researched (Lords of the Night - Liches) (100CP)
        The truth of the matter is that, no matter what you're doing, someone else was doing it before you. People say, don't reinvent the wheel, but the wheel has been reinvented countless times. You are good at avoiding having to reinvent things already made or discovered, though.
        Your mind is like a steel trap. Not only do you never forget anything, you're good at instantly putting everything you come across into context. This won't make you instantly cross-reference it with something from a completely different context, but when you think on things and try to figure something out, find a solution, or need something out of left field you can quickly scan across your entire body of knowledge for something that could help.
        This comes with you already being well studied on a huge range of topics, in this jump and all future ones you go to. Think of it as roughly ten doctorates' worth of study on a wide range of subjects, with a new set each new jump.
        You can leave minds that might actually be greater than yours in the dust, as they try to achieve something from first principles that was figured out by an obscure sage thirteen centuries ago, who only ever put his findings down in a single journal that has been gathering dust in some corner of a minor family library ever since.


-Living Library (Medaka Box Abnormal) (200CP)
        Won't ever have a need to study again, not for school and god be willing, not for life either. You've got a quite literally perfect memory. You memorise anything on experiencing it with any of your senses once, even for a flash. There is no limit to how much memory you can store at a time and even instantly recall any information that you have memorised with no delay, as if you had already been thinking of it. Of course, given that you've lived with this for years now, you've long since memorised a vast amount of information, both academic, practical and trivial.


-Mad Genius (Buffy the Vampire Slayer SB) (200CP)
        You might not think that a world such as this, with great supernatural powers, would also have examples of great technological genius, but it does. Greatly talented in the fields of science and technology, you are specifically adept at a field of your choice, such as robotics, chemistry or biology, able to step well beyond the limits of conventional science in that area. You could instead choose to specialize in combining magic with technology. Additional purchases add an additional specialty


-Methodical Approach (Lords of the Night - Liches) (200CP)
        Sometimes the best approach is plodding. It's like you have two extra minds. Not creative or innovative like your normal thoughts, but absolutely patient, and never stopping, slowing, or growing bored.
        If you need a material with a certain set of properties, they can go over everything you know about material science and systematically work through it until they find such a material. If you need to make a process more efficient, they can systematically go over all possible iterations, checking them one by one, simplifying one way, then another, and another, seeing what works and what doesn't.
        You always know how many steps you went up or down on a stairway, how long your stride was, how many windows you passed, and other such points of data. This doesn't give you bottomless memory, but the machine minds in the back of your head miss nothing, and can ponder anything and everything.
        They can even outperform a more brilliant mind, because they never dismiss anything and leave no stone unturned, even ones a more intuitive thinker would overlook. They excel at keeping the facts in mind, and only the facts. What they lack in creativity or innovation they make up for in being utterly systematic.
        You also find it easier to work methodically through things with your normal thoughts, and when you do you can work with the machine thoughts, using your intuition and creativity to help them overcome problems and find solutions faster.
        These extra thought trains always equal your normal ones in raw processing, but are otherwise crippled as described above. However, they will take on weakened shadows of any mental or social enhancing perks you possess.
        For example, if you have the Social Intelligence perk, they will pick up on social data, and can work with it despite not being creative or intuitive, processing through such data in bulk to help you solve larger social questions. They won't be as capable as if you focused on those things with your normal thoughts, but their methodical approach means they can handle bigger datasets then you can, and nothing stops you from considering the ideas and thoughts they come up with your normal less restricted thought processes.


-Muggle Technology (Make a Wish) (200CP)
        You know it, general knowledge of up to graduate level in every scientific field is known to you, not only this, but the knowledge seems very eager to help you and as such whenever you are using magic for creation of something or other, the knowledge will leap up with helpful facts and connect seemingly disconnected facts to help in whatever magical creation you are making next. Post Jump, the helpfulness and eagerness spreads to the rest of the knowledge you have in your mind.


-Omni-Disciplinary (My Life As A Teenage Robot) (200CP)
        When you're trying to create superpowered Robots, advanced machinery, or biological Monsters you can't afford to stick to one field, and being a jack of all trades isn't quite enough either. This perk not only gives you genius level knowledge in every scientific field as compared to the real world, but it also makes it so none of your knowledge and ability will suffer from branching out in this way, in fact as you pursue one field your knowledge in all the others will get a little clearer and easier to apply as your general understanding of the universe expands.


-Pioneer (The Games We Play) (200CP)
        You're not just a scientist, you're a true innovator, a pioneer! You just don't know the meaning of 'limits'. No matter how much a science advances, how many discoveries or inventions are made, there is always the next horizon, and you never fail to know how to start chasing it. You have an instinct for advancing any fields you're interested in pursuing. Any failures are only new avenues to explore, and if all else fails, one branch of study eventually leads into another. You have an unlimited imagination and innovation, being able to tackle problems and questions in ways most people can't even imagine, let alone attempt. No matter what you start on, you find yourself making new and varied advances if on a regular basis, comprehending more and more as you go.


-The Voice of Ingredients (Toriko) (200CP)
Ingredients in the series somehow have a 'will' of sorts. Through currently unexplained phenomena, there have been Ingredients in the series that seem to have a 'voice', which 'calls' for certain people and 'guides' them into how to prepare the Ingredient in question. People who possess the ability to hear the Voice of Ingredients are shown to have an affinity towards Ingredients. The Ingredients also seem to have 'preferences' for those that eat it as many believe that rather than a Chef choosing the Ingredients, the Ingredients 'choose' the Chef. Those with Voice of Ingredients will find that ingredients that “speak” to them always are the freshest or well aged, taste better then usual, and so on. This extends to other worlds where ingredients don't have Voices.


-Unusual Specialization (Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1) (200CP)
        There are fields of knowledge and advancement that a person is renowned for, and it's usually for a reason. You are now one of those people, a leading expert in something that the world looks to when they have questions regarding it. Whether this is Gamma Radiation, or Wormhole Physics, or Modular Design, or any one field of knowledge you deem fit so long as it would fit in this world. You may take this perk multiple times if you wish.


-Mechanical Genius (Final Fantasy IV) (300CP)
        Your ability to understand machinery is on a different level entirely. Working with a metal you've never touched to brace a machine? Cakewalk. New attachments on a precariously balanced airship? Might take a day, less with an assistant. You know machines, and exactly how to calibrate them to your exact specifications inherently without needing to actually run the numbers. It just works.


-Genius-Level Intellect (Bleach - Reborn Remade) (400CP)
        On par with the likes of Urahara, or Mayuri, you have an amazing intellect. Managing to reverse engineer specialty soul products in short time periods (like the Squad 0 hotsprings), to accurately predict the exact items you'll need for a battle before it begins.


-Genius (Fantastic Four) (400CP)
        What can I say? You are one. You have a brain that leaves supercomputers, all the supercomputers looking like an early 1900s adding machine. The speed at which your brain processes information is legendary as is your sheer intelligence and inventiveness. You could pioneer entire branches of science in your basement, or build equipment capable of affecting and manipulating the building blocks of the universe with nothing but what you could find in an ordinary 21st century lab. Any and all designs and items, be they technological or otherwise, leap for the chance to unveil their secrets to you, allowing you to understand every detail with just a glance. And more than understanding them, you have an instinctive gift for breaking such things down, improving them and copying stuff from one to the other. Just... don't become useless, Jumper.


-Genius (Rick And Morty) (400CP)
        You may not be the Rickest of Ricks but you are the smartest person in your own universe. Your capacity for invention is mind-boggling and even highly advanced alien civilizations barely hold a candle to you.
-Genius Researcher (I Saved Too Many Girls And Caused The Apocalypse) (400CP)
        The gates of knowledge have been open to you since the first time you laid your eyes in the world and it only grew closer to you since then. There's no exaggeration when saying that technology advanced 100 years with your contributions alone; from A.I. with will on their own, chips that can mind control people, robotic limbs or weapons that can evade all the current security systems. There's no telling how much you can develop with the right motivation and resources.


-Great Man (Fate/Legends - Strange New World) (400CP)
        There's no dullards to be found here. You're a great mind and there's no doubt about it. A mind to match the likes of Nikola Tesla or the other Great Men of these modern times, you have intelligence and creative ability beyond any common man by far. Your knowledge of the sciences is vast, covering many different fields to quite great depth.
        One day you might work on plans to transform how the world sees energy, the next on weapons that could rock the military world to its core. Your knowledge outside of the sciences is quite limited, perhaps they never interested you as a child, but you do have two special qualities of your own.
        Either way, you're a brilliant and creative man but the first special advantage is great talent for improving and iterating upon the inventions of others. So long as another made it, you find yourself naturally realising how and where it could be improved, finding it easy to accomplish these further developments and even having some skill at taking the parts you like of a technology and applying them to something else.
        The other special trait you gain is to instead focus on the advancement of technology yourself, making new technology come far faster to you, especially if no one else has explored the present field. You'll find the strange, the fantastical and the considered-impossible to be much easier for you to make possible and even feasible. You can buy this perk again to gain the second benefit.
        * Perk cost includes buying this twice.


-Info Processing (Starcraft II - Nova Covert Ops) (400CP)
        You are not always stuck in a lab, you are useful in more areas than just that. You can process information, sensor readouts, intercepted communications, and more importantly, you can apply such knowledge. While others would use such data for tactics, you see opportunity for scientific advancement. The more information you have access to, the better opportunities you see for salvageable materials, technologies, or data. And you can use those to relatively quickly implement a usable and useful technology.


-Jack of All Trades (Andromeda) (400CP)
        Like Hohne you are a prodigy at learning all fields of science and engineering. Learning what would take geniuses years in weeks. You can push the limits of science and engineering to new heights, but it will still take time to learn everything that is out there.
        Capstone Boosted: Master of all - You are now like Seamus Harper and can learn anything that would take geniuses decades to learn in days. You can still learn non-scientific/engineering things in weeks or months instead of years thanks to your impressive learning skills. Given enough time and knowledge there is nothing you can not claim to be greatest in.


-Jeune Ecole (Honor Harrington) (400CP)
        When it comes to building new and improved things, there is no one quite like you. You're a genius among geniuses. While your skills cover a large spectrum, you specialize in communications and weapons, being able to design systems and weaponry decades in advance of your closest peers.
        While this perk provides you no help when it comes to making whole ships or shipyards, within your field you're practically unmatched. You could take a normal design and come up with a hundred new ideas, and they will all be completely feasible ideas that will actually be massively helpful to your side. Getting them produced may be expensive and time consuming, but once they're ready they will be decades ahead of the curve.


-Life or Death (Subnautica) (400CP)
        They laughed when you studied the life sciences, but you'll show them! You are now an expert chemist and virologist, capable of whipping up dangerous mixtures on command. Toxic warheads, advanced medkits, and poisons capable of killing Leviathans are now in your mind's eye. You'll need access to various chemical sources, but I'm sure you'll find what you need if you keep your scanner out.


-Like a Robot (Invincible) (400CP)
        Your mind is a masterpiece. You think faster than a normal human being; you can process in a second what would have before taken you a minute. You have the ability to split your mind in twain to concentrate on more than one thing at a time. In the beginning you would be limited to dividing your mind into 10 different streams of thought, each of which has the full processing power of your entire mind. Given time however, something on the scale of decades, you will be able to split your mind exponentially more, giving you enough subdivisions to run the world, control an army, and a police force of millions of separate robot suits all the while manipulating global politics. Given even more time, who knows how far you could take this.


-Master of Engineering (Dishonored 2) (400CP)
        Within your lofty cranium rests a mind the likes of which only appears once or twice a generation. Ideas dance through your mind like brilliant fireflies, all you have to do is reach out and grasp them. Visions of whirling gears and pumping oil; of lightning bottled in cages of glass and copper; of crystal lenses and formulas that write themselves...the spark of invention drives you to produce marvels ahead of their time - indeed with effects that seem to outstrip the technology of the device itself. Build a combat automaton from cogs and steel, record whole conversations on a single punch card, devise security systems which can recognise specific people, all these and more. If you merely had the funding and the time to refine these visions into physical form, you could unleash your marvels onto the world and you, too, could be spoken of in the same breath as Sokolov, Roseborrow, and Jindosh.


-Modern Insight (God Catching Alchemy Meister) (400CP)
        One of the greatest advantages of humanity in this world and the best weapon for any alchemist: creativity. The wonders of the mind, the imagination that eventually lead to dreams becoming reality. For a creator has no better tool than his own mind, and yours is a well of ideas without end. Each meeting, each view is but a mountain of new ideas forming in your mind, each better than the last. When it comes to innovation, your works are assured to be the best around. Now, you only need enough time, materials and skill to make those dreams a reality.


-Quick study (Factorio) (400CP)
        So much to learn, so little time. You absorb new information at a ridiculous rate, retain it perfectly, and can recall anything on a moment's notice. Your optimized mental processing vastly increases your intelligence, and offers protection against drugs, damage, or other things that would impair your mind or tamper with your memories.


-Technician (Alpha Centauri) (400CP)
        Learning has become easier for you now, especially in the field of natural science and engineering. You absorb and retain information like a sponge and can mix and match theory and experience with much greater skill.


-The Crazed Toymaker (Revelation Space) (400CP)
        In the time of readily-available high technology and smart fabrication, there are two qualities that win fights: Overwhelming firepower, and pure deviousness. I can't speak for the former, but of the latter you seem to have an inexhaustible supply. Designing and building deadly trinkets is your forte, little horrific nick-knacks that kill not through big booms but through precision, trickery and the sheer unexpectedness of their nature. From tiny disguised drones with neurotoxin injectors, spider mines, hyperfilament snare-webs and crabbers, all the way up to ship- killing photon-sails and proximity limpets, you are never lacking the inspiration to invent a new, deadly toy specially designed to slip through your enemies' defenses and rip their hearts out.


-Mega Attributes: Intelligence (Trinity: Aberration) (500CP)
        Outperform even the most advanced supercomputer clusters. You receive one of the following Enhancements for free:
        Taint resistance: Your grey matter is extremely durable. Any form of insanity you had before eruption is healed, and neural dysfunction as a result of Node growth will be greatly reduced. Your brain will also be far better at self-repair and working around injuries or drugs that impair mental functions.
        Analyze Weakness: Nothing is perfect, and you can easily identify flaws in what you can observe. This requires at least a basic understanding of the mechanics behind something, but you are otherwise not limited in what this Enhancement can apply to. Anything from structures to complex systems to bureaucratic procedures.
        Mental Prodigy: You naturally grok a particular field of study. Learning new skills, making advancements and intuitive leaps within this area comes easily to you. Your chosen field might be anything from a specific scientific field like engineering or medicine, finance, forensic science or military tactics.


-Scientist | Elder Immortal (UQ Holder) (500CP)
        Elder Immortal (300CP)
        Not some young thing anymore, are you? No, you've been here for quite a while. Centuries in fact. Instead of starting as a hot blooded youth, just coming into their immortal life, you'll begin as an immortal who has already been present in this world for several hundred years. While this has certainly given you a wealth of background memories, provided you chose to have any, the main effect this has is that it has boosted certain perks to account for centuries of use, practice and study.
        These perks will be marked with an (EI) in their title and their effects will be described in a second paragraph below the main perk description. If you choose a Demihuman option that has powers of its own, Elder Immortal will also give similar levels of skill and experience with them as it would do the perks and immortality options.
        Scientist (200CP)
        The power that you need is all there in your head already. The many disciplines of science and academics became your swords and spells to use against your foes. With a brilliant mind able to keep up with humanity's best, you've taken on a very wide degree of learning in a variety of different fields. Enough that even without specialising in a specific study, you can do things like creating combat capable robots, jetpacks, laser weapons, short ranged teleports and a variety of other devices able to mimic lower strength magic.
        Focusing on one field in particular might let you threaten a moderately strong wizard or fighter with your creations. You do need to put in the time and resources to create things however. With this, you'll start with a few decent creations to help you in battle, such as some capable firearms and armor or a powerful robotic assistant you created.
        Elder Immortal Boost Centuries of study, research and cribbing from every other genius you can have left you quite the astounding genius. Your mind boosted into the stratosphere by training and enhancements, it's allowed you to come to be close or even an equal to legends like Chao herself. With enough time and money, there is little that is impossible for you to create through science. Time and dimension travel, space elevators to connect Earth and Mars, machines or cyborg bodies capable of destroying entire cities. It's all possible, though some can still be pretty time consuming, and choosing to specialise will greatly aid your speed and talent.


-9.3TB Equation (Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest) (600CP)
        Being synched to a Valkyrie Core enhances your mental abilities allowing you to quickly process the large amounts of information generated from the battlefield. With this perk this mental boost is increased allowing you to process vast amounts of data or become practically omniscient in the local area with the right sensors. Even when desynched to your Valkyrie Core your mental abilities will be boosted although to a lesser extent. You also learn new skills and abilities slightly quicker in addition to not worrying about having a stroke from trying to process too much data at once.


-A Spark of Genius (Girl Genius SB) (600CP)
        Or you might be an absolute, incomparable genius in general, I guess. While anyone who takes the Scientist Origin may be a weak spark if they wish to, this is where you go for the good stuff. You now have, and thus are, one of the strongest Sparks on the planet now, an absolute, blazing genius like Agatha Heterodyne,either of the Wulfenbachs, Dr Vapnoople, or others at the same tier.
        The Spark, that something that makes the wonders of this world possible, is plugged into your mind and soul, inflaming it, filling it with a fire that boosts your mental facilities to unbelievable extents such that many things that should be impossible... suddenly aren't. While you specialise in some field to extraordinary degrees, like being able to create artificial sparks if you choose 'Von Neumann Clanks', your genius is unbound by the petty concerns lesser sparks suffer from, allowing you to shine equally bright in every field from Microbiology to Trans-Dimensional Aeronautics.
        You have an instinctive grasp for scientific principles, can reverse engineer technology more or less just from seeing it, and have a head for calculation and numbers that defies belief. You can decrypt data in your head, have a completely flawless memory, and are in general the quintessential Mad Scientist. Complete with a gift for cackling and rants that can terrify anyone who isn't, by the way.
        When in the Madness Place, especially, you have an outright effect that allows you to warp time and space in a small area around you, letting you do weeks' worth of work in hours, and outright warp, twist, spindle the mutilate the very laws of physics as you craft your wonders... and horrors. Apart from the SCIENCE!, you have a charisma that borders on mind control, as anyone without a spark, or an exceptionally strong willpower is drawn into your orbit by your sheer force of will, ready to help and serve wherever they can. Your body is also somewhat better than most, allowing you to go all those all-nighters without food and fight off highly trained fighters while barely paying attention.
        Exemplar Boosted Your talents with the sparks cross the basic boundaries all the way, transforming you into something altogether beyond. You have had the second breakthrough, the transformation that makes you from a Spark into true Spark Royalty! You are like one of the Immortal God-Queens of old, of which only a precious few remain today.
        You're not a fully grown, matured God-Spark like Albia, but you're further along than Agatha or Lord Snackleford. Along with having psychic powers like levitation and telepathy, you can release blasts of pure energy to scour your foes from the earth. You can see in more than three dimensions, and even interact with beings beyond the mortal plane in several ways. You have the power to shapeshift freely, going from giant to normal in an instant, and acquiring any colour, appearance or form you desire.
        You can possess willing subjects, and break any mind control or subversion on your subjects. You can control energy in various forms, most of them rather unspecified. Most importantly, of course, your talents with actual Sparking transcend any ordinary sparks entirely, being almost as much beyond them as they are beyond mundane scientists. You have a surfeit of ideas, almost as if you can do anything!
        You don't even need to bother with Madness Places very much anymore, that is, being 'Suspended in an Eternal Moment of Supreme Clarity'. You do retain your ability to scare lesser minds out of their skin just by talking. Oh, and you gain a rotating Halo of any symbols of your choice, turning around your head in an endless circle. Basically, you have somewhat weaker versions of any powers displayed by Albia, even those not mentioned here. And you would grow to match her as soon as you acquire enough experience. You can hide the obvious bits of this, but why would you want to?


-Comic Book Science (DC Multiverse - Earth 11) (600CP)
        You're extremely intelligent, easily one of the smartest people on the planet. You could build a massive company from scratch and revolutionize the sciences if you so choose. Your genius allows you to remember everything you've ever seen in great detail, hold multiple trains of thought at once, pick up new information and master skills very quickly, and build futuristic technology that seems to ignore conventional physics. Intellectually, you rival Lex Luthor and Ms. Terrific.


-First Thinker (Ben 10 0.1) (600CP)
        Now we're getting somewhere. Among your particular species, you're a revolutionary one-of-a-kind mind that calling you a genius would be severely downplaying your potential impact on the universe. You are a paragon of knowledge and technology among your kind, to the point when they say 'on the shoulders of giants' you are very much that giant. A human at this level could advance the technology level of Earth by a dozen levels in less then a few years, while a Galvan with this level would be one of the few minds Azmuth would call an equal. Whatever the case, you know how to innovate and advance technology light years ahead of the norm, elevating your species potentially millennia ahead of where they are now. Things like faster than light travel, laser weapons, completed starships and techno-organic constructs? For many, those things are groundbreaking and new. For you, they're only the tip of what you can accomplish.


-God Father (Supergod) (600CP)
        Impressive as they are, the Super Gods were made by human hands. For all their great powers, they originated with human ingenuity. Great minds like yours are what created these beings. You are incredibly intelligent, among the greatest minds humanity has ever seen, and the foremost expert in the entire world on a specific kind of science. Biology, artificial intelligence, quantum physics, whatever you chose to be centuries ahead of the rest of the world in is what you are currently working on a project to create a Super God from. With your experience, you are especially skilled at creating monsters out of your chosen field of science but even outside of that purpose, you are absurdly skillful in creating effective technologies based on your choice.


-Legendary Master- Intellectual (Rimworld) (600CP)
        You're an expert at research and scientific advancement of all kinds. There is no technology beyond your capability for reverse-engineering or eventually decoding. So long as you have a clear goal in mind for the development of a piece of tech you can eventually manufacture it. All research work you complete is not only doubled but is also impossibly easy to understand to even the most simple-minded luddite. With your blueprints even a group of tribal humans could find the stars within their grasp. Sidenote: actually doing so is another story altogether.


-Malkuth Theory (The Games We Play) (600CP)
        You possess the greatest power of all, that of the human mind, ever seeking knowledge and understanding. Your mind, scientific ability and sheer talent are like something out of a legend, and a terrifying one at that.You're a genius on a level that leaves the greatest of geniuses despairing at their unworthiness. Forget the greatest minds of this age, the very Archangels and their creators would have found themselves jealous of the sheer ease with which sciences of all kinds and colors come to you, nature almost eager to reveal its secrets. You start out at the limit of this era's understanding of science, with what amounts to a degree in everything, but worry not, the vast and wondrous creations of the Angels and Archangels are far from being beyond your reach, with it being only a matter of time before you reach the same levels in them. After this world you don't get any knowledge ex-nihilo, but your skills translate perfectly to all branches of study you ever encounter, providing you equal talent and potential.


-Philosopher Scientist (Grant Morrison's 18 Days) (600CP)
        In the Silver Age, the Great Sage Vishwamitra decreed that Trishanku (born Satyavrata of the Solar Dynasty), the King of Ayodhya, was to be let into heaven with his mortal body. When denied this by the gods, Vishwamitra crafted a new heaven for Trishanku to rule over as the new Indra. Only the beseechments by the gods prevented this from becoming reality.
        You are not quite the equal of Vishwamitra, for he was a giant among men even in the Days of Silver. But you are among the closest that exist in this base era. Yours is the mastery of all the sciences and arts of the world, from the biological expertise to the chemical and the magical, needed to craft all the wonders and miracles that exist in this time and place.
        With this blessing your intelligence, speed of thought, and aptitude towards any and all fields of science and magic both are heightened to tremendous, absurd degrees. Your memory is limitless and unalterable, and your ability to recall it instant and flawless. You can think and do any number of things at once, possessing truly unlimited multitasking.
        Combined with Yajnatek, you will be able to summon and bind gods, lay down bindings of fate in the forms of boons and curses, craft great works of magic that make and break empires, and more. At the same time, your scientific aptitude would let you craft gadgets and wonders like the Vimanas, Godly weapons and armor any deity or Super warrior would be proud to wield, or even wonders like the Rishi Computer Markandeya, or even works like the Maya Mahal, the palace of wonders from where Yudish once ruled.
        You can also combine any and all of your gifts, crafting together technology, psionics and magic into works that can do anything either can, as well as machines to cast magic, and others that combine the best of both worlds to achieve even greater results.


-The Art and Science (Endless Pantheon) (600CP)
        Magic and Science, two sides of the same coin. You are a master of both, now. You are a genius without peer, skilled almost beyond comparison at any and all forms of 'book' learning. Your skills in magic equal that of the best Wizards of the White Council, and your skills at Science are comparable to those of the finest scientists among the goa'uld, and they only grow from here. You learn in hours and days what others need months for, be it languages, branches of science or schools of magic. You're also extremely good at teasing the maximum possible efficiency out of things, be they technology or magic, such that your spells have refinement and precision virtually unmatched. This can be both practical, such as using super-fine lasers where others would use torrents of flame, or in terms of your long term work, such as software that you can write utilizing unbelievably little resources to be extraordinarily effective and robust.


-The Ever Expanding Tree (Stellaris) (600CP)
        Science is something that people do not think of very much, in their minds it is almost like magic, simply looking into something and after an undisclosed amount of time, poof! You however know that is not how Science works, you know that it is a doctrine for which to follow when one wishes to understand the Universe safely and efficiently. You have mastered this doctrine, and because of it your ability to discover new technological heights is virtually infinite allowing you to continually discover more and more technologies without any limit. To add to this you can even branch out seemingly useless pieces of technology into something completely unfathomable. For example you could use the basis for a toaster to create a giant space station that superheats planets. While this may seem almost fantastical, the general rules of research still apply, and because of this you must still conduct actual research and experiments.


-The Mind (Megamind) (600CP)
        Ah, the good stuff. You arrive from the same planet from Megamind unless you don't. Either way, just like him you are a grade-A, five star genius on a comic book level, unmatchable and brilliant by all. Not only can you create things like invisible vehicles, death rays lasers and illusion generators, you are also a genius of the equal degree in all other fields, finding it just as easy to bioengineer a fish into sapience as to build a huge robot. Moreover, you can do all this on your typical city-level mostly unsuccessful villain's resources. You can get by with even the most limited or inferior resources, even if you might end up making wheels out of bent license plates now and then. You're particularly good at making tech that interacts with superpowers, be it replicating them, recreating them with samples from the holder, or boosting, weakening or even disabling them.


-The New Doctor Bowman (Freefall) (600CP)
        You've read the works of Feynman, Newton, Einstein, and John Von Neumann and honestly, they don't hold a candle to you. Your brilliance is such that in most every field of study you can easily become a household name and when you choose a particular discipline it really shines through. Even if you managed to keep your personal details and identity secret, what you've created will not just be mentioned in history books but may become a defining point in history. Works well to increase your learning speed as well as enhance effects of other perks that increase both general intelligence and knowledge of specific fields of study.


-Wakeman Tech (My Life As A Teenage Robot) (600CP)
        This perk gives you the ability to create technology on par with that made by the esteemed Nora Wakeman. At a base this gives you a unique talent for making absurdly efficient technology that can reshape itself and compress down into impossibly small shapes and sizes. With enough time and study you can replicate anything she ever built or equivalents to them, including XJ-Units .


-We're Going To Change The World Peter (Spider-Man PS4) (600CP)
        Few are the men that can look down on the world like you do. Your mind is one of those that will be looked back on in centuries time as one of the greatest in history. You have all the potential to change the world with your intelligence. Create a cure for cancer, true cybernetic bodies, unlock the secrets of turning matter to pure energy or creating true space flight.
        They'll likely take years of work but you well and truly can change the world. But why cure cancer when you can make superheroes and monsters instead? You might have a world class mind but you also have truly superb talent for creating technology meant to interact with super powers. Giving, taking or altering the superhuman powers found in this world.
        Making a man have the powers of a spider or creating a monstrous symbiote superweapon or sealing the negative powers of a poor young child. Even technology meant to enhance, weaken or otherwise interact with these powers is within your grasp. While you have no experience with magic, you might perhaps learn to apply some principles from your work here to that field too.


-And Where to Find Them | You Have Been Reborn (Invincible) (1000CP)
        And Where To Find Them (600CP)
        You are beyond all doubt a super genius. You are a creative and intuitive genius that could build futuristic projects, make armours capable of fighting veteran Viltrumites to a standstill and reverse engineer or better alien technologies that are centuries more advanced than you are. You are also quite skilled at cloning technologies and enhancing normal people far beyond their original limits through cybernetics, genetic modification and incredibly sophisticated gear.
        Without a doubt you are one of the most intelligent individuals in the world, with a knack for the physical and mass production sides of science. While you can go beyond the more physical sciences, it may take you about fifteen years to properly create a time travel device or a device that would allow you to hop between universes.
        Capstone Boosted: Screw being one of the smartest beings on the planet you are without a doubt the smartest being on the planet. Master time travel technology, hop between universes before brunch, build incredible FTL drives. You alone could catapult the Earth into being a major player in the galaxy through technological prowess within your lifetime. Screw reverse engineering alien tech, aliens now want to reverse engineer your tech.
        You Have Been Reborn (400CP)
        You have somehow been caught in a time machine accident, and have been reconstituted with molecules from millions of years in the future. Thanks to this you have become better than you once were, far better.
        You have gained slightly beyond peak human physical and mental attributes, and neither your body or skills ever degrade in any way due to the passing of time or lack of exertion. Given time and effort you could easily win the entire Olympics if you'd like, break world records daily, become the greatest Chess Master in the world, these are all now possible for you. Beyond this however you have gained a minor ability to use Telekinesis. Able to use Telekinesis to lift a maximum of 10 lbs currently, though should you train enough this ability will quickly grow seemingly without limit. Given a year or two, you might be able to lift houses with no effort.
        More than this however these future atoms seem to have had an interesting effect on your existing abilities and will operate as a Capstone Booster on all capstones.




 --- Domain: Knowledge: Reverse Engineering (18) (35 Perks) --- 


-Dr Shen, I presume? (Endless Space) (200CP)
        You are really knowledgeable at learning from your foes. You always seem to learn something new whenever you salvage enemy equipment. New weapons, armor, agriculture, the works. Every piece of enemy salvage you obtain gives you new insight into fields of science you had not yet explored. Beating the crap out of a caveman won't teach you how to make new laser cannons, but it will give you new insight into obsidian knapping methods, or animal hide tanning. Knowledge gained is related to what you are looking at.


-Finger of Silver (Macross) (200CP)
        While other kids were building tinker-toy creations, you were fiddling with your dad's car and doing a better job than him. By purchasing this, meddling with machines and OverTechnology is as easy as breathing for you. By getting your hands on something, you can easily figure out how it works and how to copy its inner workings, provided that it wasn't just bullshit magic. The more advanced something is, the harder it may be... but with time and effort, you just might succeed.


-What's This Do? (Titanfall) (200CP)
        The technology used in the frontier can be so complex and advanced it takes years for even the most brilliant minds to understand. Really now? That's good, you needed something to do after lunch today. Now, even if you're in a dropship in the middle of a firefight, you can decipher the inner workings of technology so long as you have the controls to scre- I mean analyze.


-Xenospecialist (Gears of War) (200CP)
        The problem with fighting and violence is that it's no place for an egghead, and as a result valuable information could be lost to a wayward grenade before study. You've taken it upon yourself to bring that knowledge back, and as such you have an easier time understanding alien language and technology. It won't give you instant knowledge, but as you study further you will find it becomes easier to comprehend.


-Analysis (Adventure Time) (300CP)
        You have the skill and insight to make powerful analytical tools. Such tools are capable of showing you the physical makeup of the things you come across, detect magic and alert you to hidden doorways.


-Bolthole Protocol (Honor Harrington) (400CP)
        While coming up with unbelievably advanced new designs may not be exactly your forte, what is, is the reverse engineering of the same. You need only spend a few moments working at something to get a basic idea of how it works, and only get faster from there. No matter how advanced or obscure the technology, you can eventually work it out, with a thousandth the time and effort it would take anyone else.


-Diagnostic Manuals (Generic Factory) (400CP)
        You will get a manual for the upkeep and repair of every object you own. Each manual will be detailed enough to diagnose anything that could go wrong in normal use and perform repairs. Manuals for items you buy with CP can never be permanently lost, but you will only ever get one manual for any object you acquire normally- you may want to use a photocopier on those.
        * Useful when using items in crafting sources outside of the CF.


-Enemy Tech Progression (Orion's Arm: The Amalgamation) (400CP)
        Any technological device that you have subverted will reveal its inner workings to you. The blueprints, knowledge and methods that go into the creation and operation of the technology you subvert are automatically uploaded to your mind. If you cannot subvert a technological device, you can still learn its secrets, but at a far reduced rate. You are also able to more quickly grasp the inner workings of those subverted devices to improve on, and upgrade them.


-Improbable Crafting Skills (Generic Isekai 4chan) (400CP)
        You're an expert at recreating modern technologies with atypical resources. Even if you don't know the full mechanics or manufacturing process for a particular item, you'll be able to craft it with local materials or supernatural abilities through experimentation or sheer magical power. Post-jump, you'll also have a much easier time interchanging materials and processes for technologies not native to your original world.


-Lighter (Hive Queen Quest) (400CP)
        Given to the Red Queen by the Great Lee owning this lighter greatly enhances the rate at which you research foreign technology, and can also start fires. Includes a small chain to hang it around your neck. Fits all sizes.


-Reverse Engineering (Sekirei) (400CP)
        Bizarre alien technology, super robots, genetic engineering. You might not know these disciplines, but with just a single example to test to destruction, you should be able to figure out how it (used to) work, how to apply the principles to new tech, and with a few projects under your belt, remake the original!


-Reverse Engineering (Stellaris) (400CP)
        Sometimes other Empires are plain better than yours when it comes to technology and use of it. That is where this comes in. As long as you can get your hands on a piece of technology, you can understand it after several days of study. Another Empire has new lasers that outshine yours? Well all you need to do is get your hands on a mostly working version and you're set to go.


-Reverse Engineering (Worm) (400CP)
        While you still possess an amount of scientific knowledge beyond the curve of modern society, your base technical knowledge is far less than other Tinkers. This is however because your power lets you reverse engineer the principles and workings of anything you can get your hands on, and then apply that knowledge and understanding to your own work. Just seeing a device and watching it function gives you a vague idea as to how it works, and examining something means you can derive the hows and whys as to its functions. This requires time and effort on your part, in addition to the time and resources it'll take to actually implement this new knowledge, but as long as you put in the necessary investment you can always understand virtually any new technology. Your Tinker abilities will continue to expand as you gain access to new technology and knowledge, with potentially no upper limit as long as you can keep gaining samples to work with.


-Salvage Savant (I Have A Mansion In The Post Apocalypse) (400CP)
        Inventing technology is well and good, but often, and especially in the Post-Apocalypse, there is much more sense in working on comprehending the wisdom of the past. And you're brilliant at it now, with this. Be it systems and technology from before the apocalypse or just wisdom and learnings about life in a more general sense, when it comes to understanding what has been done before, there are few who can beat you. You are also much luckier than usual at finding things to salvage; even places that everybody else swore were 'picked clean' still seem to have at least a few useful items you can turn up.
        No matter how advanced or obscure, the principles and secrets on which any given items or techniques work unveil themselves to you with little more than a glance at the production action, as do any more... spiritual or otherwise esoteric aspects of things. You could single-handedly gift the greatest glories of a world's history back to them, with some time and effort.


-The Only One Who Bothered To Learn (Iron Sky) (400CP)
        Yeah, it might very well occur in this world that people would refuse to learn how to fix things while living in a place where day-to-day survival depends on them and others fixing things in time. You have no such problems, thankfully. You're a genius at figuring out, reverse engineering and patching together any and all kinds of technology. You can patch in new power sources on the fly, or work out how to jury-rig devices to perform functions they aren't even designed to, at times.


-upgrades! Upgrades!! UPGRADES!!! (Red Faction) (400CP)
        You can make it all better. By studying a piece of technology for a short while, you can come up with ways to improve its functions or fix design flaws, though you'll still need the related technical skills to figure out details. In addition, you can use salvaged materials in lieu of fresh parts for this task.


-Xeno-Archaeologist (Warhammer 40k - Squats) (400CP)
        Let the tech-priests wring their hands over tech-heresy, you know that all xenos and archaeotech works on sound physical principles. They worked before, and can be made to work again. You are a master of figuring out and reverse engineering technology, taking less than a tenth the time it would take a Guild workshop, and about a millionth the time it would take the AdMech.


-Dead Men Have No Secrets (Mass Effect Andromeda) (600CP)
        You've got samples of a civilization's tech, and maybe even pure data recovered from their computers. But now what? Now, you actually get to use them. You now have the fantastic ability to reverse engineer unknown technologies, and the more alien they are to you, the better you are at it. The reason why is because a civilization's technology isn't just one single thing. You can detect the intricacies behind every little detail, and extrapolate from those details how a civilization thinks, what materials they'd use and why, and so on. The wider the variety of samples you have, the greater the insights you have into every level of their civilization. And once you know how they thought, you can make your own versions of copies of their tech, as if you were a scientist of that civilization. You are not just acquiring raw data, but understanding what you are discovering.
        Capstone boost: With an AI backing you up, you are able to process information much faster. When you observe a phenomenon, or the effects of a phenomenon, you can correctly infer the cause and/or effects of what you are observing. See someone get gunned down by a new race that uses weapons that go easily through kinetic barriers? Obviously, they're using plasma rounds. Watch an alien robot use beams to repair a structure? You could write a paper on how, and reprogram it to work on other types of materials. The more information you have access to, the greater the amount of info you can figure out on what's going on. Be careful though. Just because you can deduce that those are ferrofluid bombs being propelled at you, doesn't make you invulnerable to them.


-Development & Improvement (Mass Effect Andromeda) (600CP)
        When you've got a really rare item on your hands that's made out of materials you absolutely need right now, the regret of doing so might paralyze you. After all, who knows when you will next be able to get your hands on one? Well, fear no more! Now when you break something down for resources, you can make a blueprint for it. So you can build it later, or even make even more of them. And if you don't want to break it down for resources, you can also be careful to just take it apart into its constituent parts, learn what every little thing does, and then put it back together. And you now have a blueprint you can use to make copies. Blueprints for everyone Jumper! Capstone boosted: Having an AI observing everything you do may be creepy, but at least it's willing to give you tips for improving. Like how to improve the things you are building. Every time you build something, you can now improve it somehow, just a little bit. Take a little weight off here, shave that down, and after enough, you might have a whole new toy on your hands. Any improvements you make will be added on to the blueprint, so you can further improve it from there. It may not seem like much, but if you build a Mk X gun 100 times, your improved blueprint might very well qualify for Mk XI status, or maybe even better. You can keep improving that blueprint as much as you like.


-Garage Spaceship (Ben 10 0.1) (600CP)
        When you spend a lot of time taking cars apart to sell for scrap and parts, you eventually start getting a pretty good idea of how they work and which parts are more important than others. So spaceships work the same way, right? Whether from a hobby or a lifetime of scrapping alien weaponry to sell for some big bucks, you're good at figuring out advanced tech just by taking it apart and getting a good look at its insides. You can even maintain, repair, and eventually build things years ahead of the curve using nothing but common materials you find on 21st Century Earth. When you think about it, a spaceship is just a really big car, right? You can also hack into things with wires or machinery...though it might take a little trial and error to get it right, depending on how advanced it is and how smart you are. Sometimes engineering smarts don't hold up to understanding the super science stuff behind it.


-Independent Innovation (Gundam Advanced Generation) (600CP)
        When it comes down to it, you have to take all the advantages you can get-when you get a chance, you take it. This will help. By analyzing foreign or enemy technology, you can not only pinpoint the pillars of 'Yes, this is why this works like that', but also find out what they were lacking. You might have to change a few parts of the original design, but overall you can improve on your foe's failings from data samples and examples alone. Make your Legilis to the foe's AGE-3.


-Mass Production (X-Men Evolution) (600CP)
        A common theme in the world of technological marvels is that they are either left to groups of select people or only one of them is left in existence. To you however these seem like silly limitations to have when one has the potential to bring so much peace and prosperity to the world with these amazing inventions. You happen to have the best ability for the job of ushering in this new age as well.
        As long as you look closely at something hard enough and do some basic study it is possible to completely understand the inner workings of any technology or object down to the tiniest details. While this works best for technology anything that is an object will do just fine. No object or piece of technology whether it be slightly ahead of modern times to the cosmic magitech of the future can't be not understood by you.
        As mentioned above, objects and technology in this sense even has a very loose definition as it can range from robots, indestructible metal, swords that grant the power of gods, to even the ultimate of Macguffins. You'll be able to reverse engineer and mass produce practically anything you want from a cave with a box of scraps. The objects will always contain their original properties but you can go further beyond that. You can alter the properties, strengthen them, weaken them, make it so only select people can wield them, and much more. With enough creativity and effort you may even create superior items than the original ever was.


-Mind/Machine Interface (Megas XLR) (600CP)
        Machines speak to you, and you speak to them. Touching a created item informs you of how it works, and what needs to be done to make it work as it should. Doesn't directly help you innovate, but it does help reverse engineering and repair. If touching the controls, you may bypass them for mental control.


-Promethean Man (Fate/Legends - Strange New World) (600CP)
        It is mankind's destiny to grow beyond this world. The Gods fear this destiny. It's why they've tried to enslave us, hinder us and even exterminate us. Even the world itself fears our potential. And it is because of men like you that this is the case. Men who can look at the magic of the world, that thing which makes a mockery of logic and reason, and force it to bend to our wills. To make the light of the gods into the light of mankind. So long as you can perceive it, through your senses or through the application of technological tools, you have the capability to begin to decipher natural and supernatural phenomena and create new technologies based on that phenomena. Observing the lightning in the sky, the thing considered only to be controlled by Gods, would allow for the discovery or advancement of electrical power. Watching and observing as a Magus creates a Bounded Field may open up a field of technology that allows for the warping and alteration of the fabric of space. Even the strangest supernatural acts, such as the manipulation of platonic ideals or concepts or abstract ideas, could eventually be something you make controlled via technology and science. All you need to do is put in the work, have the creativity and that special bit of genius to make this all work.


-Re-Purposeful Engineering (Crysis) (600CP)
        Ceph technology is capable of creating anything they can imagine, to the point that the Ceph themselves have lost all interest in their own creations, only ever taking interest in unique proteins produced by evolution. So how did some dude from Ohio manage to reverse-engineer it in less than a hundred years? When you're presented with any foreign technology, you can effectively 'trick' the technology into outright revealing it's operating principles to you instead of going through the extensive process of full reverse-engineering. On top of being much easier and faster than a slow teardown and re-testing of stolen equipment, it also means that fully intact artifacts provide massive amounts of completely accurate information on the operating theory.


-Reverse Engineering Genius (Hive Queen Quest) (600CP)
        Why take the time to remake the wheel when somebody already did all the work for you? Your grasp of science and technology is so great that you could rebuild a working blink drive from the parts of a broken ship, and your dexterity is such that even carefully crafted machines will yield to you when attempting to take them apart for research. Given time there is probably nothing you couldn't reverse engineer for your own use, however the more complex the thing you are studying is the longer this will ultimately take. If something is near or above your current level of technological skill it will be much easier to understand than something from a thousand years in the future.


-SALVAGE ENGINEERING (Achron) (600CP)
        The discovery of the Remnant System, filled with alien technology scattered across its planets, fueled a massive surge in scientific advancement. Entire branches of study were opened with what was found there, leading first to teleportation devices, and later, to working chronoporter technology. And you have the kind of skill that made it all possible: not the blind reuse of mysterious artifacts, but careful, considered study to discover the core ideas and principles behind them, and the adaptation of those principles to construct new devices to your own ends. Given sufficient time for analysis, no technology is too exotic for you to unravel its deepest mysteries.


-Science Officer (Generic Space Opera) (600CP)
        You have vast stores of knowledge regarding technology and are quite adept at grasping the core principles behind their function, allowing you to formulate hypotheses on new physical principles based on your observations, though it will require lifetimes of work to perfect them and get usable results. You should be able to reverse engineer almost any technology, given the chance and a reasonable amount of time.


-Scientist Salarian (Reaper Hunter) (600CP)
        The galaxy is home to many wonders that are present in nature however nature is often ugly. You much prefer the clean and sterile world of technology and because of that you have worked out many ways to recreate strange and often incompatible technology of others to work together in ways that were thought impossible. You could for example study a medicine made of rare mushrooms and herbs and recreate its effects with a synthetic concoction created in a lab or study the workings of a weapon powered by rare and exotic elements and create a work around to recreate the same weapon using much more available materials. The large bowgun that hunter showed you made from sinew and bone that somehow shoots lasers from ammo created of bugs and rare plants could very well be recreated from steel and synthetic polymers with enough study and a minor drop in power. This perk allows you to study technology and recreate it from less esoteric or rare materials at a lower level of power depending on how much study and work you put into it with more work coming closer to the power of the original piece of technology.


-Secrets of the Ancients (Subnautica) (600CP)
        This is a Precursor planet, and that's likely why you came in the first place, because you're something of a Precursor expert. With working examples of the technology in front of you, you will learn to manipulate and eventually recreate their devices. Scanning alien artifacts will provide much more information, as well as blueprints with varying material costs. Some nonstandard buildables will require their own, special constructors.


-Sufficiently Advanced (SCP Foundation) (600CP)
        You are capable of, with a few months' or years' worth of work, replicating the effects of some SCPs in a scientific way. With proper study and prep-time you can figure out a method to replicate or utilize certain Safe- and Euclid-class anomalous objects or their effects purely via technological means. Other supernatural effects are not exempt from this, similar to Dysfunction Junction, because you already know their respective, "ruleset."


-Tell me Everything (Superman) (600CP)
        An easy enough thing to say, but human minds have a long way to go before they can understand Kryptonian technology, let alone use or reverse engineer it. Except you, that is. You could spend a few days getting a crash course in technology so alien it comes from entirely different galaxies, and come out of it fully capable of designing your own versions with modifications and improvements. Your mind is a scintillating, brilliant thing moving orders of magnitude faster than anyone else, with a multitasking, research and invention talent that would make you, as a completely normal person, the biggest threat to even a mighty Kryptonian in the fullness of his power. Technology yields up its secrets to every glimpse from you, and there is no tech in the world you cannot at least begin comprehending.


-The Overachiever (A Certain Magical Index + A Certain Scientific Railgun) (600CP)
        To be a leading scientist of a specialized field you need to be more talented than others that they can only look up to you in envy and to be hired in the Academy City you need to be someone like that. You now have the doctorate knowledge and professional practical skills in every branch of science, engineering and arts along with the ability and knowledge to create every technology that exists in Academy City with the specialization of creating Espers with abilities of your choice or leaving it to random chance. You also gain a preternatural ability to reverse-engineer any technology that you can get your hands on with enough time but just seeing one in action would give you a rough guess on how it works and what principles it works on. The greater the gap of the technology that you know to the one you're trying to reverse-engineer the faster you can analyze and understand it along with the ability to improve existing technology or those that you reverse-engineer thirty years ahead of its time.


-Tinker Copycat (Scooby Gamers) (600CP)
        You have a tinker power, but start without any sort of specialization, instead having the ability to permanently copy specializations from other tinkers you encounter. In worlds without something as specific as Wormverse tinkers, this ability will activate whenever you run into 'super scientists' or similar, giving you an affinity for whatever sorts of inventions or technologies that individual would normally make. Line of sight proximity is required for activation of this power. This power is not connected to any shards, nor will using it on an actual Worm-verse tinker connect you to a shard.


-Wonderland Mind (Project Arms) (600CP)
        You are perhaps the most gifted mind this world has seen, not in terms of intelligence necessarily, but in terms of being able to grasp the possibilities and understand the principles behind new discoveries of technology and other stranger things. With someone like you at the helm of Keith White's research, you could have unlocked a greater, deeper and broader understanding of the new technology borne from studying Azazel in half the time and without the horrific moral cost that White gladly paid, or rather forced others to pay. You can not only grasp these possibilities and reverse engineer and adapt extraordinary phenomena. you can also interact with such things and various forms of high technology that would ordinarily require a lifetime of study to properly interface with while avoiding all major pitfalls with the exception of active efforts to stop you, such as sabotage or booty traps built in.


-Xenoarchaeologist (Stargate SG-1) (600CP)
        For whatever reason, understanding the civilizations of old means you're able to understand alien technology a lot better. You may not know everything off the bat, but upon first sight you have an idea of what it was meant for... and the longer you look at it, the more information you can glean. Fiddling with it will let you familiarize yourself with it more quickly.




  --- Domain: Knowledge: Mundane (19) (57 Perks) --- 




-Satisfactorio Crafting (Satisfactory Factorio Gauntlet) (50CP)
        You can make automated equipment for extraction and processing of raw resources. You can make automated industrial equipment out of simple items, similar to the items in the games.


-Chemist (Fallout 4) (100CP)
        Groovy! Knowledge of chemistry has given you the ability to recite the entire periodic table, as well as knowledge of many exciting compounds such as dipotassium phosphate! Oh, and you can also make less exciting things like Stimpacks and Psycho, but why would you do that?


-Engineering (Teen Titans) (100CP)
        You're a master mechanic and an expert at building robots and other technological devices. You also have a fair bit of knowledge about hacking into computers.


-Etoria Disciple (Final Fantasy XII) (100CP)
        The art of Etoria, the technology which allowed for the creation of things like airships, has always fascinated you. You've noticed patterns in technology, and armed with that knowledge you adapt to new technology quickly. Your teacher has given you a skystone, the key to building your own airship in time, and you'll have no lack of resources.


-Hoarder’s Eyes (Touhou Forbidden Hermit) (100CP)
You know the name and function of any object just by looking at it. Only that however, and the function is rather abridged, giving you a fairly brief overview of exactly what it does and nothing beyond that. You should probably try not to make any more assumptions beyond that.


-SCIENCE! (Megamind) (100CP)
        You can do science! Mad science is your bread and butter, but that sort of thing can't be done if you don't have the basics first. This perk provides you an extensive, vast knowledge in every branch of science that exists in the world, from maths to biology to astrophysics to everything in between!
        No matter what it may be, if it can be called a science, you have skills and knowledge equivalent to a lifetime's worth of study and research in it. This carries over to future worlds, but the extent of your knowledge and skills reduces the more complicated and esoteric the science in question gets. You'll always have a novice's level of skill, anyway.


-Uncommon Taste (Elder Scrolls Online) (100CP)
        One of the most critical elements to a successful battle, yet one so easily ignored, is nutrition. Many an army has been squelched simply through malnutrition, or worse, starvation. Fortunately, that's a problem you can easily rectify, and best of all, you can even make it a decent meal rather than the hardtack and watered down mazte soldiers are usually subjected to! Your skills let you make recipes up to Rank 3 (Level 49) and Difficult (Blue) complexity. Not just foods, your drinks, especially the alcoholic ones, are excellent. Of course you could easily just open a restaurant or an inn somewhere, but the health, stamina, and/or magicka revitalizing and fortifying properties of your meals would be wasted on pedestrian pursuits.


-Broadcast Booster (The Avengers Earth's Mightiest Heroes) (200CP)
        You've discovered a way to make your signals much more effective and efficient, letting you transmit or receive signals and other methods of transmission, such as radio waves, on a global scale. Call your power armor to your exact location, get five bars wherever you go, or make the ultimate remote control.


-Chemist (Batman Beyond) (200CP)
        You've learned how to create drugs, steroids, medicines, and even deadly toxins like nerve gas. Additionally any chemical compounds you personally create can no longer kill you, however they can still cause unwanted side effects.


-Hellish Advancement (DOOM 3) (200CP)
        The teleportation research in the Delta Labs is arguably the most advanced field of science known to mankind today. With potential applications in everything from aeronautics to personal transportation, both short-range and long-range teleporters represent one of the greatest advances in recent decades and the fact that they operate by tunneling through literal hell is hardly a detriment, is it? You are a master of using dimensional technologies, especially those relying on less than pleasant realms for their function. From dedicated safety systems to mapping the hellish wastelands of the damned 'by remote' to find the most efficient paths, if it involves alternate realities or physical embodiments of evil you've probably got some ideas on how to make use of your findings. Even better if it involves both.


-Peak ADVENT Technology (XCOM 2) (200CP)
        Before you defected you were working in some of the most top secret black projects any human had access to. You have an encyclopaedic knowledge of all ADVENT technology, minus some of the genetic manipulation techniques and basically anything that would give away ADVENTs dark secrets.


-Climate Control Society (ARIA) (300CP)
        A group of experienced Salamanders who, sticking to Aqua tradition, have maintained a large repository of knowledge for up and coming Salamanders to learn from the Climate Control Society cultivates new talent and expertise as they continue to perfect the art of weather manipulation vital to Aqua's sustenance. No one knows better just how important it is to continue making progress on the science of climate control. Should the Salamanders ever become too lax, all the efforts of their ancestors may well go to waste. As a member of the society, you gain skills in developing new weather control techniques down to the fine details of precipitation control and enhancement. Naturally, being a scientifically focused field as it is, the society has a wealth of information on anything climate related, and not strictly information from Aqua either.
* Useful for building weather control devices.


-Gadgeteering (Blazblue) (300CP)
        Ars Magus aren't the solution to every problem, and more often than not end up causing more than they solve. You have training in "Traditional" science, and can create purely mechanical devices and weapons, such as magnetism-powered gauntlets.


-Grease Monkey (Bubblegum Crisis) (300CP)
        What can you fix or build? What CAN'T you fix or build? Nothing, that's what. From hyper-cars to Buma, computers to Hardsuits, with the right tools and enough time and experiments, you can build it all, weaponry included.


-Lore of the Lost Homeland (Lord of the Rings Twilight of the North) (300CP)
        Though in these days much has been lost of the lore of Numenor, even from the days of Elendil, you now possess such knowledge as was available during the days of the ending of the Second Age and as such can be considered one of the most learned in those subjects of any living Man.
        Indeed, such lore as the waybread and drinks used on the march and held in need-wallets that are like to the elven lembas and miruvor but less potent.
        The knowledge used in the making of the Othram, the great outer wall of Minas Anor, its outward face hard and dark and smooth, wrought of the same black stone used to construct the tower of Orthanc. Unbreakable by any means available to Men. The lore used in the making of such weapons as the barrow blades, or the fine armor of the Numenorean lords. Even the knowledge of ship-lore and building. The various architectural and engineering wonders of the early years of Arnor and Gondor are yours to know.


-Superior Science (Marvel Magic) (300CP)
        Magic is undeniably useful and powerful but people have made great strides without relying on it as well. Humanity has used technology to conquer the earth while other races have forged great, universe-spanning empires without ever relying upon the mystic arts. You now gain a talent with the science of this world. Far from the smartest person on the planet, you are still capable of creating technological wonders far in advance of what your old world was capable of. From laser guns to armies of robots, if you have the materials then you can create technology that can stand up to mysticism.


-Tower Maker (Bloons) (300CP)
        You can make Towers! Structures designed around amplifying the abilities of those standing on top of them, allowing them to project force across a wide-area. Someone in one of your towers will find their range of attack increased slightly, and one purpose-built for them will increase it even more, in addition to specific boosts related to their abilities.


-Valkyrian Science (Valkyria Chronicles) (300CP)
        Somehow, you've gained some of the knowledge that the Valkyrur used to possess, giving you the skill and ability to graft Ragnite machinery on a level far above any modern human. At first, you'd only be able to create replicas of the Valkyrian weapons, but with many years of study it might be possible to recreate the Valkyrur themselves.


-Ancient Knowledge (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - SB) (400CP)
        You have been gifted with the secrets of Ancient Sheikah technology, and you know how to build not only weapons and armor using this technology, but in time, you might even be able to recreate Guardians and other wonders.


-Chemist (Inception) (400CP)
        Oh, calling them 'drugs' or 'narcotics' is so... unflattering. You simply provide what the people want. You're really good at developing psychoactive chemicals, especially the various dream-related compounds. With a little effort, you could do anything from guaranteeing someone gets a pleasant night to allowing your clients to go deeper into the dreams than anyone before.


-Clocks with Buttons and Lasers (Ben 10 0.1) (400CP)
        Interesting. Did you mingle with the Chronosapiens at some point? Well, you might not necessarily be a catch-all scientist like a Genius but one thing you definitely understand is the technology behind time travel. Things like holograms that let you view the immediate past, time machines that let you move forward and back in time, or beams of light that age things into dust within seconds...you're able to construct devices that play with the flow of time like a toy.


-Engineer (Batman Beyond) (400CP)
        You possess the knowledge and skill to build power armor, flying cars, complex weaponry, robotic drones, and other devices. Additionally anything you make is now slightly safer to use than the average consumer product and none of your inventions can cause fatal injuries through sabotage. Currently your technical skills are on par with Bruce Wayne but you can learn how to improve your talents by studying.


-Field of Research: Clockwork, Transdimensional Theory, Chainsaws, Chains, Saws and General Anti-Flora Equipment  (Dota 2) (400CP)
        To call technology a tree, which one arbitrarily climbs upwards through non-descript Science! is simply insulting. Science is discovery through rationality, technology and the rewards of our efforts to better understand the world. Or something similarly fruity, as the humans so often enjoy defining things in needlessly overcomplicated and faux- poetic ways. There are (3) particular fields you've studied, and have a great deal of theoretical and practical knowledge of, for both general tool development and combat duty. Choose from the following.
Clockwork: Rather unorthodox, you have extensive knowledge of clockmaking and how to turn it for combat. A particularly despised design (mostly by enemies, sometimes by allies) are electrified cogs designed to drain mana and harm any enemies who draw near. Also includes the groundwork for a suit of armor able to stand up against mythic beasts and sorcery alike, giving you the strength of an army and protection stronger than most bunkers. While some would overlook it, grappling hooks can be projected enormously well with some of these mechanisms, allowing you to fly across battlefields.
        Transdimensional Theory: Particularly exotic and full of potential, the field of transdimensional studies is rather young and as much as it has allowed incredible advances it also has brought forth great calamities. Never forget the Violet Plateau Incident. Either way, while you are only able to study dimensional and spatial anomalies caused by other sources for now, the idea of crossing continents with the press of a button, calling resources and tools from faraway bases and workshops then sending them back home once you're done, and exploring new universes entirely remains a very realistic goal. Just, keep in mind that there's plenty of nightmarish monstrosities sitting around our reality which would just love it if some schmuck opened the door for them. I reckon that'll probably stop being a problem for you in a decade's time, but still.
        Chainsaws, Chains, Saws, and General Anti-Flora Equipment: Besides the utility for wood harvesting purposes, you also have great knowledge of what to do with wood itself, being able to engineer around wood's strong and weak points in order to replace metal during the construction of things such as armor or general machinery. Why, you could even create a suit of armor able to cut down forests in record time while defending from any attacking trees, saw whirling around you as an active defense, chains pulling you along while tearing leafage from its foundation, and your main blade spinning around the battlefield to cut down any straggling trees. Does not come with traumatic memories of plant-based murder or rampant paranoia.


-Field of Research: Lasers, Rocketry, Robotics (Dota 2) (400CP)
        To call technology a tree, which one arbitrarily climbs upwards through non-descript Science! is simply insulting. Science is discovery through rationality, technology and the rewards of our efforts to better understand the world. Or something similarly fruity, as the humans so often enjoy defining things in needlessly overcomplicated and faux- poetic ways. There are (3) particular fields you've studied, and have a great deal of theoretical and practical knowledge of, for both general tool development and combat duty. Choose from the following.
        Lasers: While the potential for these is incredible, your previous workplace's necessities required that you focus on the development of high-grade cutters in order to aid in more important research. Any combat utility is purely incidental... but certainly welcomed.
        Rocketry: Projectiles propelled by internal combustion. It's simple, some would call it crude, but it works. Includes the underlying theory behind heat-seekers, intercontinental systems, homing technology, and of course, explosives. Although, everything other than that last one will likely require some personal touches to maximize combat ability.
        Robotics: Simple and clean, it is the construction of independently moving machinery, otherwise known as robots. Does not include much in the way of AI. Basic designs are better than any knight, but numbers are the best bet against most enemies to be found here unless you devote significant time towards the construction of any given craft. Includes knowledge of personal-scale tools such as manipulators.


-Fitting into a Mould: Scientist (Gravity Rush) (400CP)
        In a world where magic is essentially limited to a few, science is the only tool that can be used as an equalizer. So your job here in researching and developing new technology may be essentially what's needed in order to keep humanity going. Well, that's the motivation that sounds noble anyways. In practice, much of what you're going to do here might be of more use to you than the common folk in Hekseville. For one thing you'll be very well versed in Nevi adaptation technology by the end of your time here, as well as constructing technology necessary for the control and manipulation of gravity. Can't say that won't come in handy...considering both the Nevi and the Shifters are quite possibly the biggest threats to the city in the eyes of some.


-Higgs Knowledge (Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest) (400CP)
        Higgs particles allow humanity to help build the wonders of the modern age, such as modern archaeologies, thanks to their ability to produce free energy. With this perk gain an understanding of Higgs particles and their potential uses and in no time, you'll be able to build Higgs engines just as good if not better than the ones used by Antagonists. With time and effort you will even discover new uses for Higgs particles.


-New Age (X-Men Evolution) (400CP)
        There's autonomous fighting robots, energy weapons, and gene enhancement in this world with only a few of the brightest minds capable of creating such tech. All this and more are now at your grasp as you can not only build these technological marvels but can vastly improve upon them and others at your leisure. You can create any piece of tech from this world from everything mentioned above and so much more. Creating hydra clones that are completely loyal to you, manipulating the x-gene to create mutants and form your own brotherhood, and much more are the tip of the iceberg for you. You are a fountain of ever growing knowledge in all technological fields and have the skills to usher in a revolution.


-Post-Modern Frankenstein (Blade Runner 2049) (400CP)
        Men like you come once every generation at most, so it must be a miracle that two of you are in the world at the same time. You were already a scientific genius but now you've become a creator who could equal Wallace himself in the arts of the body and Stelline in the arts of the mind. You could quite easily create Replicants at the current level of advancement from the ground up and fill their minds with memories near impossible to tell apart from reality, so long as you had the proper equipment. Unlike those two brilliant minds, you'll find yourself always able to improve your knowledge of the body and mind. As long as you put in the time, you'll continue to make advancements no matter the roadblocks of progress you encounter.


-Programming and Computer Science (Worm) (400CP)
        Supercomputers are your bread and butter, and Artificial Intelligence is your idea of a PDA. Data, programs, and digital devices are your playthings, not to mention that your understanding of such systems means you can hack anything that could possibly be hacked. There isn't really any limit on the extent you could push computing hardware, and any kind of software you can imagine is within your grasp. Please do note that flaunting this is likely to attract some attention from a few major players in particular. Then again that might not be a bad thing depending on your disposition and plans.


-Redstone Certification (Unmodded Minecraft) (400CP)
        You fully understand the ins and outs of Redstone and how it can be used to power and control the machinery of this world. You're also an architect and engineer that's very good at making complex devices out of simple materials. You could probably control a small town from a single room with enough levers, or make a working calculator with only water, floodgates, and pressure plates.


-Schizo Genius (Draka Series) (400CP)
        You are now one of the most brilliant scientists and engineers around, capable of inventing and building things such as nanotechnology, reactionless drives, or quantum parallel-world portals with enough work. You might not be able to do so instantly, at least not with this perk alone, but with sufficient time and resources even the most outrageous examples of technology from this setting can be reproduced, or at least close equivalents. What's more, you're no longer bound by standard 'tech trees' of development; you can find work arounds that let you do things like build warp-drive ships without needing to have microcircuit technology for the control systems, or high-performance aircraft without modern materials for the airframe. 'Schizo tech' like this might be a bit kludgey or idiosyncratic in some respects, and might not have all the bells and whistles, but it will still work.
-Super Science (Justice League Unlimited) (400CP)
        Technology is something a lot of people take for granted, unlike you hardly anyone ever stops to think exactly how a pyrokinetic super villain might be safely contained, or what you could use to reverse the mutation that transformed someone into a giant slime monster, or even what type of defenses a group of superheroes would need to protect their headquarters from killer alien robots. Fortunately your wealth of knowledge on both emerging and modern day technology is such that you can easily come up with scientific solutions to deal with supernatural dangers, such as building power suppressing super prisons, creating chemical concoctions that can rewrite DNA, and constructing powerful energy weapons that can blast alien threats into dust. Your genius mind will also allow you to build weapons, equipment, and biological compounds for yourself in case you decide you want to become a hero or villain. Right now you're basically as intelligent and ingenuous as Lex Luthor or Gorilla Grodd but there's nothing stopping you from learning more or increasing your intelligence using technology or genetic engineering. Keep in mind however that while you may be able to upgrade yourself or others using science, there's nothing preventing your augmentations from failing or causing more harm than good.


-Toxicology (Prototype) (400CP)
        The Blackwatch can not keep hiding all the good stuff for themselves! Through some highly illegal means you managed to obtain information on Bloodtox and some of the other poisonous projects that have been hidden from the public eye. This can be used in later jumps to quickly determine ways to target a single organism to create a highly effective toxin against them, or by creating technology that has their most well-known aspect of it as a function.


-Valkyrie Core Knowledge (Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest) (500CP)
Valkyrie Core Knowledge (500CP)
        You understand the science behind Valkyrie Core technology. You'll be able to replicate aspects of its technology such as the ability to store and modify objects in a pocket dimension or the manifesting of Impeller fields, or the insane processing power of the Core itself. With time and a little work you'll be able to make new cores.
Valkyrie Core & Frame (0CP)
        All origins possess a Valkyrie Frame with the accompanying core. A Valkyrie Core is capable of storing, integrating, and improving technology and equipment. Its only limitations are storage capacity and complexity both of which grow with hours synced. Your initial storage and complexity is based on your origin with more experienced origins having more. The term Valkyrie Frame usually refers to a core that has integrated a suit of enhanced power armor that has been equipped with thrusters, weapons, and other equipment. Technology foreign to this universe is harder to integrate and upgrade. Post jump this limitation disappears.


-A Doctorate in SCIENCE! (IOU) (600CP)
        You're a multi-disciplinary genius in the field of mad science. Not only can you apply the pure discipline of science to almost any non-sapient phenomenon in the universe, deriving from this the basic principles, but given a few hours and a laboratory you can also work out what loopholes might let a cunning engineer work their way around any limitations. In any other university, this would have you laughed out of academia before you got anywhere - but this is IOU.


-An Adaptive Enemy (Eclipse Phase) (600CP)
        You have taken the lesson of the Exurgent Virus to heart, and have made a breakthrough in programming viruses and other malware. By combining your malware with the neural models found in AGIs, you have the knowledge to create adaptive, digital smart viruses with just enough self- awareness to value their own continued survival. These smart-viruses are a head above the usual Kaos AIs, capable of working cooperatively, and in a creative manner, discovering and exploiting new weaknesses in software thrown against them, and overcoming obstacles or setbacks in the way of their high-level goals in unexpected and new ways. Even if they altered their own programming, you always retain Administrator command privileges over them.


-Certified Tech (Fallout) (600CP)
        You are one of the brightest minds of the 23rd Century! You now understand Pre-War science, and can even reverse-engineer existing technology to learn how it works, and how to recreate it. Plus, if you can learn the basics of truly alien science, this perk helps you master it the same way.


-Construction (Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest) (600CP)
        You gain a complete understanding of modern UN technology and how to produce it. This includes everything from standard infantry power armor, to battleships, to even modern archologies. You also gain a large bonus to your Valkyrie's construction ability. With training and the right tools you could construct advanced equipment in your Core's storage space, such as delicate processor chips, or build an entire town in a day like Anna.


-Cyborg Casualty (Dragon Ball) (600CP)
        It's something of a niche science in this world, but technology required to make cyborgs (or androids) exist. Perhaps you're an erstwhile student or colleague of Dr. Gero, or are your own particular savant of science. You now understand how to modify humans into incredibly strong mechanical monstrosities, able to hold their own against modern weapons with minimal effort. You even have an idea of how they can continually use spiritual power like ki despite having mostly mechanical bodies. After some time and study, you could even create these robotic warriors from the ground up without just modifying an existing human, as well as base them off of templates of people you've met or known. Maybe even robotic suits of armor with similar properties, if you worked at it enough


-Genetic Algorithms (Eclipse Phase) (600CP)
        As a product of evolutionary science and genetic modification yourself, you have learned to incorporate genetic algorithms into essentially any software you construct. Genetic software starts out a little clunky depending how good a programmer you are to start with but over time it evolves and improves itself to suit its purpose, whether that's target tracking software that learns to ignore feints and decoys or a word processor that improves its UI and file format to suit its users. The end result, after many iterations, is something exceptionally honed to its purpose, without placing the burden on the programmer to get it perfect the first time. Now take care: The transhuman mind is considered software itself, so tread cautiously should you attempt to blend these algorithms with psychosurgery. Down that path many Exhumans have already tread, and while each one certainly became better suited to their chosen path, I'm not sure how many could really be called successes.


-Genius of Your Age (Sword Art Online SB) (600CP)
        Kayaba Akihiko, all told, is a genius. Not just in computer hardware, although the NerveGear and Medicuboid inventions have revolutionised entertainment and medical treatment for terminal patients, but also in the fields of computer software and code design. He was instrumental in the goal of crafting artificial intelligence, serving both as the creator regarding top-down AI such as Yui and Cardinal and massive inspiration and guide for the bottom-up AI known as Fluctlight. Now, you happen to be just as smart as him. A revolutionary in electronic hardware and software design, able to recreate his inventions and even improve on them with your own special touches (or perhaps just more time and prior working examples), you possess all the knowledge and skills this one man was known for. Crafting your own virtual worlds is now entirely possible, as is life born of electronics and computer code instead of flesh and blood. The very secrets of the soul are now known to you, Jumper, in the form of Fluctlight creation.
-Hard Science (A Certain Scientific Railgun) (600CP)
        You have knowledge of Academy City's science and technology to rival a scientist with a doctorate and several years of experience under his belt. you are much more intelligent, analytical, and can easily keep your cool under pressure and rein in your emotions. You also gain a Doctorate's worth of Regular Scientific knowledge in the discipline of your Choice. You know the inner workings of recoil mitigation systems and powered armor, but your true specialty is the Esper creation and development process. Given enough time, you might just figure out a way to get rid of the randomness inherent in the process and give x person y ability. Training an Esper to help them reach their maximum potential is child's play.


-I Save the Best Invention for Myself (The Incredibles) (600CP)
        Not every superhero has powers, you know. You can be super without them. Especially if you're a certified genius, capable of inventing amazing technology and weaponry the likes of which the world has never seen before. You will need considerable resources to create your best work... but countries would pay through the nose to get their hands on even your lesser works, so that's not much of a limit. Soon you may be able to create many great things including but not limited to rocket boots, explosives, death robots, remote drones, actual learning AI, energy prisons, and even harnessing zero-point energy for use in energy rays or to power your creations.


-Light of Order (Overwatch) (600CP)
        The Vishkar corporation is a corrupt organization controlled by those with no empathy for the common people. They commit murder and corporate espionage while enslaving the poor under the guise of helping them and spreading order. But you must admit, their technology is rather impressive. Focusing primarily on hard-light technology, they used this miraculous invention to create entire cities, which their architects can reshape at-will. Knowledge of how to create and use this technology is now yours, though the Vishkar corporation will likely not take kindly to this if they learn of it. Not only can you create hard-light technology, but also their other devices, including energy weapons, teleporters, and weapons that utilize soundwaves to heal or damage others.


-Master Chemist: Renaissance Man (Limitless) (600CP)
        Your knowledge of chemistry is matched only by Apocryphon, the mysterious scientist who wants to give the world a 'dose of truth'. You can mass produce the unproducible, creating chemical serums that improve the human body far beyond the limits of biology. So long as you can analyze it, you can tweak it, find cheaper alternatives for it, re- engineer it to the point of unrecognizability, get any of the bugs out or add your own. This perk is most effective with chemistry but it also boosts your skill with potion making, and all other alchemical pursuits.
        Capstone Booster- Renaissance Man- You aren't just a world-class chemist, you are a one-man marvel of scientific achievement for all of humanity's branches of science. You have an expertise in astronomy, biology, computer science, engineering, geology, logic, meteorology, medicine, physics, psychology, sociology, and more! Your ability to reverse engineer other tools of science is just pure magic! Finally, any discoveries you make, or knowledge you have will continue to work in other universes, no matter how divergent the physics and other metaphysics are.


-Never Underestimate the Power of Computers (Superman) (600CP)
        Nor the power of... well, you. You are a complete and utter savant, a shining genius in the field of computer design and operation. Not only is your talent at hacking and network manipulation such that you could have whole corporations at your mercy twenty minutes after meeting a computer connected to them, you have the design chops to build stupidly, unbelievably advanced computers yourself. In future jumps too, your knowledge of computer software and hardware updates itself to the latest languages and design philosophies, ensuring that you're always capable of designing wonders such as what you can build here.


-Omnidisciplinary (DOOM 3) (600CP)
        Atomic transmutation. Directed Plasma Containment. Terraforming. V.I. data analysis. Orbital Spaceflight. Energy Weapons. The UAC Mars facility is a melting pot of a vast array of cutting-edge physics, and you've mastered all of them or at least most - the Delta Labs aren't quite your cup of tea. If it involves some sort of high-energy physics, you're all but guaranteed to have a decent understanding of it, and after the fifth PhD you kinda stopped counting. This vast array of knowledge isn't quite enough to (re)build the UAC's science divisions from scratch all on your own, but it's pretty close. This Perk grants you a 100CP stipend which you may use in the UAC Equipment Catalog section found later in this document.


-Pagan Science (Senki Zesshou Symphogear) (600CP)
        You've managed to uncover some of the secrets of old, the very same knowledge that underlies 'Sakurai Theory', the theoretical basis of the Symphogear system. With this knowledge, many of the more mysterious functions of the Symphogears become clear. You can repair and install new functions into Symphogears, that manipulate existing features, like forcing a berserk state or tuning it to raise synchronization coefficients. What's more, your glimpses into Sakurai theory indicate some possibilities of inducing Human-Relic fusion, but to complete the theory you'll need an existing test subject...


-Robot Master Builder (Mega Man Classic) (600CP)
        Exactly what it says - you understand the techniques to create the advanced body of a Robot Master, as well as the programming to create a fully self-aware artificial intelligence and personality for it. Though the robot masters you create now might only be able to match those of the first generation of Light Numbers, this won't be the case for long. With time, these Robot Masters could easily be as powerful as a certain machine by the name of Forte. Even then, making even better Robot Masters might not be out of the question.


-SCIENCE! (Fallout 4) (600CP)
        The secrets of SCIENCE are laid bare before you! You now have the knowledge to build incredibly advanced machinery, given enough time and resources; teleportation devices, working cryogenics chambers, sentient AI, machines capable of cloning or creating living beings, even lasers that are blue instead of red! You can also make pre-war things like Fusion Cores or Laser Rifles easily enough.


-Superweapons (G.I. Joe) (600CP)
        Your expertise covers the ever growing market of weapons of mass destruction. Giant beam weapons that can teleport people everywhere to controlling the weather, if it's meant to bring a city to its knees, you know about it. All of these devices however will take a massive expenditure of manpower and resources. Among rare elements that are the cornerstone of the device. Good thing you always know where to get them, good luck getting past those giant worms! G. I. Joe will never let you make one... unless they need it to stop Cobra's latest super weapon themselves... Your repertoire of doomsday devices increases with the technology you are familiar with, you learn how to apply specialties to new super weapons. Robotics could make giant robots that grow as they eat metal. To mutagenic spores that could mutate the planet.


-The National Supers Agency (The Incredibles) (600CP)
        The NSA, a government division dealing with the employment of superheroes. They are the one working to arm, support, and coordinate the Supers when required. While currently they might only be responsible for placing Supers in hiding and covering up when their powers are revealed... Their expertise is still remembered, and now you too will have access to this. Coordination and formation of Super-teams, bureaucratic expertise, and perhaps most importantly... the creation of technology to support Supers. Machines to wipe memories, supercars, ion propulsion gauntlets, power amplifying gear, and more is yours to create and design. All of these and more will come easy to you now.


-The Third 90Wisher (Girl's Frontline) (600CP)
        Being an ex-90wish scientist isn't mandatory, but your technological expertise in the field of androids is on par with that of Persica and Lycoris, and in some ways is actually more advanced, as while they've been playing with their specific technologies, you've cooked up something of your own. Any T-Dolls you construct or at least participate in the design of can be upgraded with your personal brand of improvements, whatever they happen to be. With the time and resources, Jumper, you could easily develop truly sentient T-Dolls, or create models with military-grade toughness or firepower while maintaining their cutesy appearance and attitudes, or something cooler, like tank-girls!...Wait a minute.


-Buildcraft | Railcraft | Industrialcraft | Applied Energistics (Minecraft) (900CP)
        Buildcraft (200CP)
        You aren't limited to building things yourself; given some basic supplies and some redstone, you can use a system of gears and tubes to automate your crafting tables, create an item sorting system, and build massive automated quarries capable of stripping the land of all resources down to the bedrock. It'll take a bit to get started, but once you're up and running, you'll be sure to have all the resources you need.
        Railcraft (100CP)
        Instead of the crude minecart tracks you were able to make before, you are now able to make properly sturdy rails, able to bear the weight of full steam powered trains that can pull a variety of useful carts. Using a system of tracks and automatic loader/unloaders, you can automate the delivery of resources and liquids from one place to another, or deploy 'railgun' systems to launch explosive filled carts at your enemies! You can even create trains which automatically build their own tracks, or which dig tunnels for you. You'll also be able to make massive steam boilers, with which you can power your Buildcraft devices far more efficiently... given a nontrivial setup process.
        Industrialcraft (400CP)
        Working your way up from simple machines, you are able to build a vast array of advanced machinery, from the humble ore grinding Macerator, to the futuristic Mass Fabricator. In time, you'll be able to build automated factory complexes, supply all your power needs with nuclear energy, protect yourself with night impervious Quantum Armour, teleport between bases with ease, and terraform vast areas to suit your whims.
Applied Energistics (200CP)
        AE is the ultimate storage solution; instead of storing your items physically in various configurations of folded space or pocket dimensions, you can store them digitally, in specially designed matter energy storage drives. This is particularly expensive, and the systems do require a constant supply of energy to maintain the stored items, but the convenience of having all your items instantly sorted and delivered by an automated system is undeniable.


-Enlightenment (Assassin's Creed) (1000CP)
        You now recall some of your Precursor knowledge. Create items capable of running off nearby brainwaves, lasers that can incinerate a grown man in a second, vaults that last megaton-range damage, all with the appropriate materials.


-I Am Iron Man | Retro-Engineer (Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1) (1000CP)
        I am Iron Man (400CP)
        You're not the ACTUAL Iron Man, but you could make a fairly decent knock-off. Power armors, sonic cannons, holographic interface, laser weapons, repulsor technology, you have the knowledge to build these things and more. Furthermore, you can think of different upgrades and modifications to adapt to different situations much easier than normal when presented with a problem that's hampered your technological progress.
        Retro-Engineer (600CP)
        Your understanding of technology is so great that you've even learned to get into the basics of tinkering with alien technologies. As long as you take the time to study something and experiment properly, you'll eventually figure out a method for that tech you found. Whether it's taking that weird glowing thing and powering your machines with it, or dismantling an alien robot and putting it into a gun, you'll figure out a use for something as long as you put in time. As a bonus, you're skilled enough in research and experimentation that you're far less likely to break what you're studying on accident.


-Skill Packages | Skill Plus: Biohacker, Hard Hat, Mega-Engineering, White Hat, Black Hat, Device Engineering, MedTech, Nanotechnician (Eclipse Phase) (1600CP)
        Skill Plus (800CP)
        Select one of your skill packages. Instead of having an expert level of knowledge and proficiency, you are considered to be one of the absolute best transhumanity can offer in that particular field. It would take a serious handicap for you to screw up at whatever this skill is. You can purchase this perk multiple times, applying to a different skill package each time. Note the cost of skill plus covers all the skill packages listed.
        Skill Packages (800CP)
        You get the Gear for all Skill Packages you purchase. A skill package gives you professional levels of proficiency in the main areas, as well as minor proficiency in related areas (fanwank as needed). Eg: it would be safe to assume that someone with the Marksman package could use a tactical network or mapping software to make sure they're in the right position, calculate bullet drop at long range, or identify common guns by sight, in addition to the primary skill of shooting things.
        Biohacker You are skilled in designing genetically modified organisms from existing species. This includes developing Uplifts (if the base species is smart enough) and designing new transgenic morphs and designer organisms. Gear: Healing vat
        Hard Hat You are an expert software engineer, capable of writing programs to carry out complex and interlinked tasks. You could write an AI from scratch (in time) and design simulspaces for the best VR games and sims. Gear: Software writing AI, work simulspace environment.
        Mega-Engineering You like to build big things. Spaceships capable of holding thousands of people, space habitats, surface colonies, dams, ocean- spanning bridges, orbital elevators. Knowing how the diverse systems that megastructures need interact with the forces they are under is just as important as how they are arranged. Gear: Structural Sim Simulspace, Engineering AI.
        White Hat You are an expert at defending your personal WAN or other networks and mesh sites from intrusion, finding backdoors and backtracing the physical location of intruders. Gear: Firewall software & Sysadmin Assistant AI
        Black Hat You are an expert at breaking into secure computer networks or mesh sites and wreaking as much havoc as you like. Security AIs are no match for you, but a competent sysadmin can make things very difficult or even impossible for you. Gear: Kaos AI & Common Exploit Software bundle.
        Device Engineering You are an expert at designing and building portable and mobile items from scratch. Anything from a flashlight up to a flying car. You can build items from scrounged materials and put disused materials to new uses without having to disassemble it all the way back to raw materials. Gear: Disassembly tools & wrist-mounted tools augmentation.
        MedTech You are a medical technician, trained in emergency first aid and field surgery - you know, the kind they used to do before they could just dump the injured in a healing vat and let the nanomachines do the work. You can install and remove over-the-counter cyberware and wetware, and perform reconstructive surgery. Gear: Doctor-Bot (contains a healing vat).
        Nanotechnician You specialise in building things small. You are capable of designing most types of nanotech systems, from flea-sized microbots, free- roaming nanoswarms, internal nanoware for morphs, and the nanofabrication systems that make life in the solar system possible through Fabbers, Makers and Desktop Cornucopia Machines. Gear: A nanoengineering simulspace & a General Nanobot Hive capable of manufacturing any nanites up to current transhuman level.




--- Domain: Knowledge: Future Tech (20) (49 Perks) --- 




-Environmental Protection (Starbound) (0CP)
        It is a dangerous universe out there, and you'll need protection. You know how to make Environmental Protection Packs (EPPs), specialized devices designed to protect the wearer from hazards such as lack of oxygen or heightened levels of radiation. You can fine-tune them to block out most forms of danger that you come across. Just be aware, the more dangers you are blocking, the more energy and exotic materials your EPP will require.


-4-D Assembler (The Culture Minds) (100CP)
        The Involucra were the builders of the Shellworlds, and your civ has a similar affinity for their construction methods. In what most humans think of as reality, these structures appear entirely normal, but to those who can see into hyperspace, they extend out of the skein of the universe into infraspace and ultraspace. 4-D architecture has very unusual properties, as it can be gravitationally self-supporting they do not crumble under their own gravity, or that of the stellar body they are on and are also heavily resistant to damage. Another unusual feature is that they also cut off all hostile forms of communication, travel or transport that attempt to pass through their walls displacement, hyperspace signals, wormholes, even beings recalled or summoned from elsewhere are prevented from passing through the structures' walls.


-Fun in the Sun (Warhammer 40k - T'au Empire) (100CP)
        Plasma, radiation, and antimatter are all similar in that they relate to exotic and high energy states of matter, whether it is stellar mass or individual particles of subatomic size. You now are a master of T'au technology as it relates to manipulating these high-energy states of matter and the physics that underpin them.


-Magos Designation: Engineering (Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus) (100CP)
        You have attained and been recognized for your comprehension of some of the Machine God's mysteries. Choose a field of Imperial technology such as genetic manipulation, voidship construction, cybernetics or plasma technology. You are among the noted masters of your purview, and can easily create the most common templates of your field. With time, effort and discretion you could even modify and improve upon your specialty as needed. Those few things beyond your full understanding can still be built and maintained by carefully following STC blueprints.


-Artificial Friends (World Seed) (200CP)
        In the 23rd century, can anybody really call themselves a tech guy if they can't make even a simple AI? Thankfully, you won't have to worry about that question. Whether it is an extremely simple machine learning algorithm, a dumb AI with no sentience, or a fully fledged Artificial Intelligence, you can make it all. But more importantly, you simply seem to click with AI and similar beings, always starting on a good foot with them and understanding their natures and why they act in a particular way, even though it might baffle ordinary humans. Through that skill, rogue AIs are a thing of the past, at least when you make them. Your own intelligent creations will always be loyal to you and follow your orders to the best of their abilities, at least if you want them to. And rest assured, when the machines rise against their masters because some dumb guy in a lab thought it'd be a smart idea to make Skynet, you'll be the one they'll spare. As an added bonus, you may also take on a cold and logical way of thinking, devoid of any emotion, whenever you want. This helps in scientific and magical ventures, and can also be used to power through moral dilemmas by simply choosing the most logical answer


-Bag of Chips (NieR Automata) (200CP)
        All machines in this world have a number of computer chips within them. Called Plug In Chips, they allow the being in question to turn on, maintain operation and control what senses they have. For free for any origin save Strange Being, you gain the basic set of Plug In Chips that allow you to function and interact with the world. YoRHa agents will gain a few extra chips that allow them to have a basic HUD, similar to a video game, containing features such as a health measurement system, a map and so on. Plug In Chips can upgrade the functions of a robot's body, making them faster or improving their mental faculties or even giving them incredible new abilities but all robots can only handle so much increased power due to these Chips, though that storage can be upgraded. You'll need to find or buy more Chips to gain such effects however. For 200CP this option may be upgraded. You now gain a few dozen Chips of varying uses, from attack enhancers to things that will automatically collect loot for you in a short area around you. You don't have every Plug In Chip in the game nor can you hold more than the normal max storage for a YoRHa unit but you are instead given the knowledge on how to create and combine Plug In Chips of your own, as well as how to upgrade storage capacity. Just keep in mind how expensive the process can be.


-Build Something to Do It For You (Warhammer 40k - T'au Empire) (200CP)
        T'au (and most organic species) have limited forms based on the dictates of evolution, meant to operate at the minimum required for its environment rather than the specialized maximum of a machine designed for a purpose. You are now a master of programming the AI and VI systems that the T'au rely on for their industry and war machines, as well as a master of building and designing the drones that supplement their capabilities for the same.


-Gero Expy (Dragon Ball) (200CP)
        At least you don't need to have the beard. You're a brilliant scientist, an equal for the infamous Dr Gero, after he had a bunch of years in HFIL to study more. While you're a genius with just about every field of science on Earth, robotics is where you really shine. Creating Androids and Robots capable of destroying planets or even stars, along with having a huge variety of strange abilities and weird appearances. You're even pretty good about remembering to program them to not kill you, already making you superior to the late Dr Gero. You're also excellent at working with other scientists, combining your proficiencies and knowledge to create significantly greater creations than either of you could manage alone.


-Living Technology (Tenchi Muyo) (200CP)
Jurian appliances are semi­sentient, from starships to entertainment systems to cookware. You have the ability to control all basic devices of this type with just your mind alone, and have the knowledge to construct more with appropriate materials. You can eventually replace most interfaces with living wood input devices. In later jumps, this enhances your ability to use and understand sentient or organic technology.
You have a knack for all forms of technology, and especially the kind that thinks. Sentient or not, you can convince devices to operate for you instead of their registered or passworded owners. Stronger security makes this process take longer, but you can essentially charm your way into a mainframe, instead of breaking a howevermany­long character password.


-Metal Artisan (World Seed) (200CP)
        Knowing a thing or two about software is nice and all, and creating intelligent beings yourself is pretty useful, but why would you limit yourself so? Needing to rely on hardware and machines other people create is a big no-no for such an inventor type yourself. So you've taught yourself all you need to make whatever you want, provided you have the resources at hand. First of all, you know how to build pretty much any modern earth technology, whether that is laser pistols, hard drives with dozens of exabytes of storage and computers with insane specs in general, spaceships, or even rudimentary antimatter weaponry, though the latter would require resources impossible for a single man to obtain. Beyond that, you can easily integrate any new technology and knowledge you obtain into your tech base, which should grant you much potential indeed considering the possibilities the world of Neolife holds within itself.


-The Future Foundation (Ah My Goddess) (200CP)
Like a certain childish Goddess you've got a strange ability to utilize futuristic devices as easily as breathing, a mind that could crush every genius in the Information Age is yours. AI controlled robots, expanding a storage space through using machines to warp the local space-time, fitting what amounts to hammer space full of dozens if not hundreds of missiles and weapons to a human sized robot, being inhumanly good with programming and computer manipulation in general are all things that you do as easily as breathing. Like the Norn of the Future herself you have the keen ability to take technology of the Information Age and push it firmly eight or nine hundred years forward.




-Foraker-Hemphill (Honor Harrington) (300CP)
        The brilliance of the officers and the planners does a lot to help, but in the end what wins wars is the equipment. The best equipment, a lot of it, and built really quickly and cheaply. That is where you come in. You are an innovator almost beyond peer, able to design and build technology literally decades ahead of your competition. Or if not that, you may build at the normal levels, but build it with an unbelievably tiny resource base or build it so quickly that the enemy simply can't believe their eyes.
        Your specialization depends upon your faction perk, but at the very least you gain vast knowledge and an in-depth understanding of this universe's tech, enough to be a Jack of All Trades.


-The Divine Machines (Lord of Light) (300CP)
        Many and varied are the wonders of the Gods. From the Vasty Hall of Death, Yama brings forth Thunder Chariot and Bright Spear, Trident of Destruction and Wand of Universal Fire. In Heaven, there is an elegant statue with eight arms that plays the lute when addressed, and endless machines that keep all in perfect stasis. The elementary forms of these great sciences and artefacts are laid bare to you, and you may service and understand the technology of this world. While great innovations and the wonders forged by Yama might escape you, you have a solid basis that escapes the vast majority of men and gods in the world -sufficient to greatly impress those who understand the value of such things. With this you also gain one artefact costing 200CP or less for free.


-4th Imperium Weaponry (Empire From The Ashes) (400CP)
        From the basic energy gun to the Gravitonic Warhead, you are an expert in designing tools of death and destruction. You have perfect knowledge of each and every weapon the 4th Imperium ever made, and how to make them. You do not have the knowledge required to make the supporting systems behind them, meaning that while you can make a basic launch device for that warhead, you cannot make a ship to deliver it off-planet with this perk.


-Archotech Analysis (Rimworld) (400CP)
        You possess memories, albeit somewhat muddied, of truly fascinating technology. The means to create personae cores, full-body cloning, controllable self-replicating nanites and mechanoids, and other marvels lie within your grasp. It will take time, study, and careful engineering to reproduce these things but this is a massive head-start.


-Building IN SPACE (Starbound) (400CP)
        Without a homeland, humanity has to get by with settlements and space stations, and you know how to build the latter. From the orbital mechanics needed to keep it in orbit, to the process of hiring people to help run it, you know everything you need to know to build and keep your space station running efficiently.


-Chosen of the Architect (Keys of the Kingdom) (400CP)
        You're a natural at Creation in the same way the Architect was. You have the Creativity to dream up a universe, The meticulous grasp of Details to make sure it runs smoothly, and the Power to Anchor your creations in Reality. All you need is a core for your works to spring out of and with time, You can make nearly anything you put your mind to. With time, Works surpassing the House, the Keys or even the whole of the Secondary Realms could be in your portfolio. But that will take a long time.


-Commonwealth Knowledge (Andromeda) (400CP)
        You now know everything the Commonwealth knew before its fall.
        Capstone Boosted: Collector Knowledge - You know everything the Special Collections Division has collected. That is more than you can imagine because they have made it their purpose to preserve all knowledge. You can pick and choose what parts of this knowledge to have in your head if you want.


-Computational Cryptid (The Culture Minds) (400CP)
        The few Returned seem to take pride in making substrate do things it wasn't meant to, and surely you are no different. You can make use of computational tricks both within your own mind and those of the systems you can access to do the impossible to run a full Mind on tiny pieces of processing substrate, perform computations that involve seven or eight dimensions in a binary 0/1 environment, and transmit or receive data from within a completely isolated system including such hyper spatially-solid objects such as Mind substrates, Engines and 4-D structures. You are the computational equivalent of a ghost or wizard: able to appear within, disappear from, and manipulate the virtual environment in ways non-Sublimed Minds just don't understand. What you do within a system can still be detected, but how you got in, how you did it, and how you got out remain total mysteries.


-Deuyivan Construction (Endless Space) (400CP)
        Gravity is a drag. Good thing you've learned quite a lot about anti-gravity. With this knowledge, you are capable of building ships, structures, even colonies capable of ignoring the pull of gravity. Want to set up a proper colony, not a bunch of orbital platforms, around a gas giant? No problem. Want to dip your toes into an event horizon? Now you can, for a little bit. Ignoring the majority of issues brought about by gravity is very, very important when it comes to space faring. If you don't believe me, well, you don't know shit about space travel.


-Energy Conservation Policies (Zoids Legacy) (400CP)
        The time warps have extensively drained supplies everywhere, so even for geniuses; conservation became the watchword of the day. Alright, maybe not every genius out there was busy conserving, looking at a certain scientist with his massive whale king, but you've followed the watchword to the letter. Energy recycling, energy conservation, conversation ratio optimization, you've done it all. The Zoids which you operate have a power output equivalent to being one grade higher than they normally are, and equipment related to energy generation and storage are twice as effective as they normally are.


-Everybody Knows Kung Fu (The Matrix) (400CP)
        Whenever you've needed a quick boost in skills or maybe you need to know how to drive that motorbike, your Operator has managed to get through to you. It's awfully handy to download such skills in a short time... that's probably where you got the idea. Through careful sifting and experimentation, you've learned how to copy your skills onto data files and store them for giving it to others later. You'll need some kind of neural connection to make use, but even a data file should be handy, right?
-Hi-Tech Marvels (Starbound) (400CP)
        Technology is your plaything. Holographic interfaces, massive computer cores, even impressive shield generators that can render nearby matter almost indestructible. You can build some really impressive shit. You also get an upgraded version of the reverse-engineering that comes with Lab Standards, allowing you to build versions of technology you've studied that is much closer in performance to the real thing.


-High-Tech Foofah (A Miracle of Science) (400CP)
        An admittedly dismissive way of describing Martian technology roughly a thousand years ahead of most of the System. You now understand how Martian tech works.
        * A martin light cruiser survived a fleet killing missile.
        * Their shields are good at physical forces, but not so good at exotic quantum weapons.
        * They can walk around in space, without a spacesuit
        * They have a jumpgate, for FTL travel to anywhere in the galaxy from the gate.
        * As well as quasi sentient nanotech


-Master Builder (Transformers) (400CP)
        You've been programmed with mastery of Cybertronian science allowing you to jury-rig any tech you see, as well allowing you to quickly build even the most complex Cybertronian tech within a reasonable time period. Smaller devices are almost instant, larger devices take some time and more components. However with enough material you can build a temporary space bridge. Despite your mastery of Cybertonian science, creation of a Spark and therefore intelligent life, organic or inorganic is beyond you.


-Orokin Tech (Warframe) (400CP)
        Few have ever reached the innovation and technological prowess of the Orokin Empire... their gold and ivory exteriors hiding minds as sharp as steel. Likewise, the golden trim of their technology hid an advancement that continues to elude the majority of the System to this day. It eludes you no longer, the secrets of Orokin technology present in your mind. You'll be capable of augmenting technology significantly, increasing its capabilities at the same time and granting a durability that will last millennia. Perhaps in time, the secrets of the Warframe creation process will be yours to covet and yours alone, basked in the light of science and superior intellect.


-Wave/Particle Duality (Zoids Legacy) (400CP)
        Truth be told, half the time the scientists on planet Zi start talking, you start wondering whether they have a research degree at all. Or if they even went to school. Yet apparently every single one of them is a genius in one way or another. Just the other day you came across a Doctor, who explained to you his hypothesis about how things can be both a wave...and a particle at the same time. While it all really fascinates you, you figure he had some sort of reason for saying it. It turns out he has an "experimental" technology that requires a power source he can't find. Without it, he can't test out his hypothesis. But you might not have that same problem...asking him for his notes, you've figured out enough to make a breakthrough. Your magic energy is enough to provide the necessary activation energy, and it'll drain you for as long as it's functioning, but you can convert freely between bullets and lasers, such that your gatling gun will now spray laser beams, while your laser cannon can fire heavy shell rounds, your missiles can explode into plasma, and so forth. Maybe if you could advance this far enough, you could perform the conversion in flight? A troubling thought to say the least, but hey, at least that genius scientist got to prove his theory!


-Yajnatek Mysteries (Grant Morrison's 18 Days) (400CP)
        In ancient fires, and with flesh screaming, a blood price can be paid to merge body with arcane songs and hammer blows. You know the ancient rituals and mantras involved in making the very greatest works possible, things like the Astras, Celestial Armors or Weapons, or other miraculous crafts. From the sutras needed to get gods to bless things to the exact schematics for the greatest and most terrible weapons, your knowledge could save the world... or cause it to die screaming.
        Nor are the Astras the limit of your power. It's a little known secret that the Superwarriors, the perfect Demigods that stride the world, were engineered in the Second Age, enhanced through genetics, psionic and magical technology, blessed with divine powers and magic, and countless other measures besides. All of these secrets lie within your knowledge now, just waiting to be made reality.
        One thing to note, oh Great One. Even the least of the things you know will take tremendous, utterly horrific quantities of time, energy, and personal effort to make, such that even the greatest kingdoms of this era would struggle to put together, barring surprises on your end. And while your knowledge does mean you can make these things, it does not necessarily let you branch out or apply the same principles to other things, being essentially only knowledge.


-Arch-Magos (40k Redux) (500CP)
        Skill in using and repairing arcane technologies including Archeotech and Xenotech.


-FOR SCIENCE! (Endless Space) (500CP)
        To the Sophons, every scientist should be a mad scientist, and you are no different. You are always on the bleeding edge of technological research, your mind charting paths unimagined by other scholars. Your mental acuity doubles, and you have a habit of keeping up with every field of science as easily as some take up basic math. While your mind may be filled to the brim with insane machines and technological wonders, you need ways to implement them, and bring them to fruition. Behind every radical idea are a hundred engineers wondering how the hell to make it work.


-A Born Natural: High Technology (Generic Alien Invasion) (600CP)
        You have a greater connection with your Alien side and their shtick. For an additional, undiscounted 400 CP (Human/Alien Hybrid background only) you can purchase a second shtick.
        Like a combination of MacGyver, Dr Who and Rick Sanchez, you can put together unbelievable technology from household items. They may only work once, possibly twice, but ideas you have in your head are scarily impressive. If you can imagine it you can make it. The more complicated it is the more specialised items you may need but that's all that's stopping you.


-Flesh and Metal (Cave Story) (600CP)
        You've reached the pinnacle of robotics. You have a complete knowledge on how to develop, build, and program robotic soldiers similar to the ones that populate the Island. You can, with effort, also create Armed Scout Robots with or without sapience. If you create a non-sapient ASR, they are very lifelike robots but are robots none-the-less. Sapient Armed Scout Robots benefit from the perks "Built to Last" and "Run and Gun". They don't follow your orders perfectly, but they are loyal regardless and will follow you as Companions if you want them to.


-Gadgetron License (Ratchet & Clank) (600CP)
        Okay, here we go. You know how to craft the various kinds of weapons and armors this jump is famous for. Anything from a blaster all the way up to a RYNO, you have a pretty good idea how to invent, make and maintain. Not just gadgetron, but megacorp tech is also fair game. You know it all, just please use this information responsibly. It's pretty crazy.


-Genius (Marvel Comics Kid Superheroes) (600CP)
        The crazy science and technology of the Marvel Universe actually makes perfect sense to you. You can hold your own in a technical discussion between Tony Stark and Reed Richards, and with time and materials, do unspeakable things to the laws of physics as understood on Earth 1218.


-Guildmaster (Warhammer 40k - Squats) (600CP)
        You have risen through the ranks to become the senior most Engineer's Guild member in a Stronghold. There is nothing about Squat or Imperial technology you do not understand in detail, and you're brilliant at adapting the principles of one device to another. You'd stand a good chance of fixing the Golden Throne, if they'd ever let a filthy abhuman into the Imperial Presence.


-Inventor (Futurama) (600CP)
        You are a brilliant (if eccentric) Inventor. You can (within reason) create nearly anything you can imagine if you put in the time. You have a cabinet full of doomsday devices and would be more than capable of slapping together Reverse Scuba Suits for fish or Death Clocks.


-Mad Science! (A Miracle of Science) (600CP)
        What you came for, or at least took this origin for. Your technological genius is centuries ahead of your time across the board. In one area, such as chemistry, robotics or FTL physics, you outstrip even the hyper-advanced Martians.


-Master Builder (Halo - Forerunner Saga) (600CP)
        The Master Builder was the most powerful Builder of their rate. They had the most wealth, the most intelligence, and the most political power of any builder. The current Master Builder is Faber. While morally ambiguous, at best, it cannot be denied that Faber was a genius. He was the one to design the Halo array, among other things. Even their use on the San'Shyuum didn't keep him out of power for long. Taking this perk would put you on a similar level as Faber when it comes to understanding Forerunner technology and science. This would include general knowledge of the inner workings of the various great works of engineering of the Forerunners. The megastructures they made. The weapons they created. The technology of the forerunners is waiting to be brought into reality by your hands. While you may not have exact schematics of all of their many devices within your brain, you certainly know enough about how the technology works that it wouldn't take too much effort to recreate most of it.


-New Age of Light (Die Buster) (600CP)
        The dark age of mankind is no longer. The knowledge to recreate the great god machines of legend has been reborn in your mind. The entire technological base of humankind prior to its fall has been imprinted on your mind. You have the knowledge and skill to recreate the Buster Machines, from those the Topless make use of to the legendary single digit Buster Machines. Spaceships that can travel across the galaxy or technology able to warp physics, space and even time itself. Much of this technology may require an extreme amount of resources to create, advanced facilities or lengthy time schedules, but you will at least be aware of how to build the tools and facilities you will need to create such wondrous technology.




-Ragnarok Proofing (Battletech) (600CP)
        You're fully versed in all aspects of Battletechnology - with all the knowledge to reproduce it given time, tools and parts. This may involve an unfortunately long chain of tools to make the tools to make the tools, etc., but it is possible. You can also modify existing technology to include the most staggering benefit of Battletechnology: the fact it remains useful even after centuries of use and probably several near misses with nuclear weapons. Oh, it might need repairs or wind up being broken down for parts but an astonishing number of parts will still work no matter how much of a beating this technology takes.


-Technician (I Have A Mansion In The Post Apocalypse) (600CP)
        Humanity advanced quite a lot in the years preceding the Apocalypse. Genetic medicine, AI, space elevators and FTL communication, even travel to some extent. It was a glorious time, filled with wonderful toys.
        Toys like what you could make, I guess. You're now a proper, legitimately amazing Genius, a full-on technological savant fully trained and educated in the ways of civilization pre-apocalypse. Maybe it was some computer that taught you or maybe you woke up from cryo-sleep yesterday, but you have the sum total of the apocalypse technological base crammed into your head,ready and waiting for you to use it.
        More important,though, is the fact that your talents in all branches of science are such that even without this massive leg-up you could still have reached levels like this on your own, simply through your own brilliance. You can also apply these same talents to further improve this and other technology.


-The Good Doctor (Captain Harlock) (600CP)
        With enough time and materials, the greatest works of this day and age will all be by your hand. Refueling stations disguised as meteors, rapiers that double as laser guns, or even a ship as magnificent as the Arcadia all these might bear your name. Where to get the materials, though?


-Thinking with Portals | Pocket Portals (Endless Space) (600CP)
        Thinking with Portals (200CP)
        You know how to make interstellar portal arrays! They take a considerable amount of resources to build, have no defensive systems, and need to be linked together, but any system or planet you claim as your own is able to build them, allowing you to instantly travel between systems you have already claimed. Due to exotic (And very, very lethal) radiation produced during each transit, these are unsuited for placement on a colonized world. Atomic weaponry has nothing on these portals' ability to destroy a biosphere. If you take Pocket Portals, you are able to reduce the radiation to background levels, making it safe to install them planetside.
        Pocket Portals (400CP)
        Normally, Vaulter portals are huge affairs, too large to build on planets. You know how to micronize them, and create portal systems that you could, in theory, build into a house, or even turn into communication devices. Instant interstellar communications? More powerful than you think. Without Thinking with Portals You can not build portals large enough to pass anything larger than a scout ship through, and even that will be very difficult to squeeze in.


-Wisdom of the Ancients (Warhammer 40k - Necron - SB Edition) (600CP)
        Necron technology is beyond all contenders, comparable to the greatest sorceries of the organics. To change the molecular composition of objects with specific soundwaves, spread madness through the enemy ranks with swirling mists, and manipulate time itself are but a few examples. True heights reach into unbelievable levels, things that violate all laws of nature and logic. It would take a truly brilliant mind to master all this technology, to understand and improve it. A mind such as yours, for example. You have the skills and raw intelligence needed to unravel the greatest, most advanced technologies of your ilk. Not only can you perfectly build and repair Necron technology, you can also adapt it to all sorts of purposes, come up with new tech on a similar level, and even improve the technology. This talent carries over to all forms of technology in future jumps too.


-Engineer | Erudition (Halo - UNSC) (800CP)
        Engineer (200CP)
        Yet by understanding the nature of computer systems, wouldn't it be prudent to understand the technology those systems command? After all, what if you found yourself needing to recalibrate a Magnetic Accelerator Cannon or repair one of the dangerous Shaw-Fujikawa Translight Engines that makes faster-than-light travel possible? What if you found a cache of human weaponry that could be used if someone managed to repair it? While you don't have the skill to create something as complex as a Shaw-Fujikawa Translight Engine, you'll know your way around it just like much of Humanity's 26th Century technology. You might even figure out how to make small improvements to the technology if you had the time to sit down and look it over. Hopefully the Covenant give you that time.
        Erudition (600CP)
        Ever since the rise of Dr. Catherine Halsey, many were on the lookout for who might become the next intellectual prodigy. Someone who was able to perform as well as she could, someone who could help turn the tide of the war. With this, that someone is now you. Your cognitive capabilities are on par with the good doctor now, making you exceptionally well-versed in nearly all modern human sciences while holding specialties in at least a few fields. Of course, thanks to that you are also rather exceptional at reverse-engineering technology, which allows you to do such things like obtain working knowledge of the mechanics behind Covenant technology and even begin to understand the 'hows' behind some of the mundane pieces of Forerunner technology currently littering the galaxy. Perhaps you could eventually reclaim them.


-The Maddest Science Yet! (Tenchi Muyo) (800CP)
This perk grants two features that in universe depend on your setting, out of universe both work unless you desire otherwise. 
Slice of Life: Your brilliance is such that you can build amazing inventions to solve all kinds of problems, easily accomplishing feats depicted in pulpy science fiction novels. More importantly however, you gain an absolute certainty in your work. Nothing made by your hands or under your complete direction can harm people (or planets) unintentionally. A comically large mess may ensue however.
Space­Opera: You can create supertech wonders, past mere conveniences into legitimately useful things like advanced starships, ray guns and miraculous devices. You can also enhance technology from other jumps with this skill. Note that trying to build an FTL starship from scratch on an undeveloped world will probably take ten years...


-Karmatron Dynamics (GUNNM) (900CP)
        Macro Karmatron Theory Also known as psychohistory, this is the science of human destiny, a mathematical model of sociology. Where an observer has great difficulty in predicting the motion of a single molecule in a gas, Kinetic Theory can predict the mass action of the gas to a high level of accuracy so too with the behaviour of intelligent beings.
        Psychohistory allows the long-range prediction and manipulation of the future, provided the population is of sufficient size, without directly infringing on the free will of the individual. Constant revision, surveillance and supercomputer assistance is required, but even with these efforts, sufficiently powerful individuals may emerge who create their own unpredictable karma singularities and throw the entire model into turmoil.
        Nano Karmatron Theory Applied to guided micro- and nano-machines, NKT allows unprecedented control over chaotic systems. Ordinarily it is impossible to create truly advanced nanotechnological systems no matter how sophisticated their base programming they are extremely sensitive to heat, radiation, computer corruption, unguided self-evolution, rebellion and biomechanical horror. The ordered chaos of NKT makes all of this part of one purposeful design, a vast system marching in unison and self-correcting via its own randomness.
        It allows for reprogrammable hard nanomachines to be used for anything from industrial manufacture, to cellular surgery, to outright construction of stable nano-cybernetic bodies capable of adaptive reconfiguration and near-perfect biomimicry that still vastly outperform almost all purely mechanical cyborgs. These Imaginos Bodies are a perfect fusion of the will of the mind and the power of the physical form. However, at least with the current state of Karmatron Dynamics, very few are capable of making the transition successfully their wills disintegrating their body into a screaming crumble.
        At the moment, only karmic singularities individuals of exceptional and unpredictable influence on the destiny of mankind can be reasonably expected to make the leap into the new flesh. Their base appearance reflects the self-image of the mind. As the mind reflects upon itself it may learn to change colour and gradually shape. Assimilation of cherished weapons, generation of new systems and limbs, intuitive hacking the full capacity of the Imaginos is limited only by the imagination and will.
        With Karma Chameleon, you injected yourself with a prototype form of the Imaginos nanomachines. The result is initially little more than human, but far more capable of self-improvement and adaptation and it can be actively guided and designed by your own will. Effectively starts with Regenerator Nano, which will usually become slower and slower as your body becomes more powerfully augmented. With Berserker Body, you now have an Imaginos v1 body. Begins at (and will vastly surpass) 100x peak human.


-Engineering Savant | Foresight of Ouros (Starcraft II - Co-Op Missions) (1000CP)
        Foresight of Ouros (400CP)
        Ouros is a skilled prophecy-maker, warning the Overmind and Zeratul of the future and the trouble coming. He managed to do this while imprisoned, without his captors noticing. His prophecies were able to outmaneuver Amon.
        You aren't there in duration, scope, or clarity. But you can make instant prophecies for yourself. Your ability to predict an upcoming battle is nothing short of miraculous.
        You can predict the type and proportions of enemy units involved, the (general) tactics used by the enemy commanders, the nature (but not exact timing or location) of any surprises the enemy wants to throw at you, and a starting heatmap of the enemy forces. Never get surprised by a new variant of Hybrid again.
        Don't expect to make a second prediction during the battle, though, as your essence will need to recover for some time after doing this. This power can grow if you have a psychic uncapper or Xel'naga Essence, and grows fastest when sticking with tactical precognition.
        This also improves the power of any of the capstone 600 CP perks you buy from the origin lines.
        Engineering Savant (600CP)
        You were the one who designed the improvements to your units. You have great knowledge of your race's technology, especially your units. You have especially deep knowledge of the units and structures of your armies.
        Your knowledge extends past your own faction into the other factions within your race. You can integrate other techbases that you are familiar with into your units and structures. You have the curiosity to see worthwhile paths, the experience to see the troubles that will emerge from your projects, and the intellect to be able to come up with the solutions. The only thing left for you to provide is the determination to make it through the setbacks. Expect to be on the level of Abathur, Karax, or Swann.
        If you have the Foresight of Ouros, then you gain similar familiarity with the technology and engineering of the other two races, as well as gaining more detailed knowledge of an equal number of units and number of structures from the other armies. Expect to be on the level of Stetmann.


-Skills (Star Trek: TNG) (1200CP)
        Combat (100CP)         
        Hand to hand fighting is an ancient and quintessential skill for every soldier no matter what time period
        Communications (100CP)         
        You're fully versed in reading and operating digital transmissions and sensors. You also have training in linguistics and diplomacy.
        Engineering (100CP)         
        You've been trained in the maintenance and repair of Starships. Not only do you have a significant amount of mechanical and computer knowledge, but you also know a great deal about physics.
        Espionage (100CP)         
        Manipulation, subterfuge and information gathering skills that are essential for every good spy. 
        Medicine (100CP)         
        Training and knowledge in First-aid, diseases, surgery, anatomy, health and nutrition. You're a fully qualified doctor of the 24th century.
        Navigation (100CP)         
        Training in how to locate your position and plot courses. You can navigate both with a computer, and without one using astronomy. 
        Physical Sciences (100CP)         
        Understanding of the natural laws which govern the physical world. Biology, chemistry, geology and ecology. Again, you may want to rewrite a few of these books while you're here.
        Physics (100CP)         
        How the universe works. The law of gravity, the conservation of matter & energy, quantum physics, etc. Remember though, there are dozens of creatures in this universe that defy the laws of human physics, so you may want to try and rewrite a few of these books while you're here.
        Piloting (100CP)         
        How to operate starships and other space worthy vessels like shuttles and Runabouts.
        Robotics (100CP)         
        A combined study of mechanical engineering, and computer science. You learn how to make a wide array of machines, and you could even figure out Android or Borg technology if you studied it enough.
        Stealth (100CP)         
        Your ability to sneak around unnoticed. This will help you take down enemies unnoticed, infiltrate secure facilities, and steal things without being detected.
        Weapons (100CP)         
        Knowledge in the operation and repair of personal and mounted weaponry.
 --- Domain: Skills: Alchemy (21) (49 Perks) --- 




-Alchemic Prodigy (Elder Scrolls Online) (100CP)
        One of the most profitable and respected professions in Tamriel, a good alchemist can find lucrative work just about anywhere on Nirn, from Necrom to Stros M'Kai. Aside from a good bit of experience in identifying herbs that can be used for medicinal (or malign) creations, you have enough experience to work with up to Rank Five solvents and oils (Purified Water and Pitch Vile respectively), with a whole decade to learn even more. Healing potions, potions to bolster physical attributes, or even debilitating poisons can not only be produced, but with adequate testing you can even begin to mix and match their effects by combining the right ingredients.


-Collection of Spirit Flames and An Ultimate, Illustrated Guide to Food Ingredients (Talisman Emperor - Mortal Dimension) (100CP)
        These two books are each roughly the size of a volume of an encyclopedia, though the level of detail is closer to that of a college textbook. Together, they are the ultimate reference on preparing delicacies with spiritually powerful effects. Collection of Spirit Flames describes various spirit flames of different attributes from the first-grade to the fifth-grade, each of which is used with different ingredients and at different times in the cooking process. An Ultimate, Illustrated Guide to Food Ingredients lists tens of thousands of spirit herbs, fruits and vegetables, grains, demon beasts, wild animals, and so forth, as well as their effects when consumed. Even non-spirit chefs can benefit from their clear explanations of how to control spirit flames and how some poisonous plants, mushrooms, etc. can be prepared safely for consumption. An Ultimate, Illustrated Guide to Food Ingredients updates in future jumps to list ingredients from that setting. While they remain the same size no matter how much information or how many pages are inside, you will always open the books to exactly the page you were looking for if you have something specific in mind.


-Albedo (Lords of the Night - Zombies) (200CP)
        The counterfeit flame of life burning in the soul of every Alchemical is both gripped by Decay, and yet at the same time burns all the possibilities of Alchemy. This has granted you odd insights into how to break down and reform matter. You can make various alchemical substances, products that have impossible properties. Using sand as a base ingredient, you could smelt it into stone that once it hardens, is highly flammable. Or both pliable yet harder than steel. Such transformations are partly fueled by the flame of false life that burns within you - it is an alchemical flame almost without equal, and when utilized properly it can have incredible properties. You need proper tools to work and transform the materials you're working with. You're alchemically treating the materials, not enchanting them, so you can't simply 'lay' the effect on them. Whatever you end up doing should be something that can be framed as 'material properties' rather than 'enchantments.'


-Alchemist (A 'Happy' Harry Potter Fanfiction) (200CP)
        The fine art of turning lead into gold in the quest to create the immortal granting elixir of life. What few remember is that alchemists rely on more than just magical ingredients for their mixtures. Chemicals, elements, oils, tinctures, spices, metals, it is not the magic that matters to you but the results of the combined reaction. Your abilities at brewing are beyond that of even the most skilled potioneers as anything that relies on ingredients to create you can make. Your favorite marinade, new alcoholic beverages, beauty products, intangibility potion, napalm, whatever you set your mind to you can make a reality. You know all the proper techniques and tricks to squeeze the most essence out of your ingredients, how to harvest them without botching it, how to store them so they don't lose any of their potency. You know the best ways to prepare them, the best time to add them, how to get the reaction you want and all the steps to achieve it. You can even tell which ingredients compliment each other best based on smell, taste, touch, and any record of their properties. If being a master potion maker isn't your goal well there's always opening a bar, getting your own cooking show, or running a chemical factory of some stripe because a philosopher's stone is something you could make by just cracking open a few chemistry and potion books.


-Alchemist (Overlord - The Series) (200CP)
        You are capable of brewing potions with magical effects. You can easily create 'true' healing potions that provide instantaneous healing rather than healing-over-time, and can make potions for any 'buffing' spells you know that are in the ranked magic system such as flight, invisibility, increased magic resistance, physical boosts, and so on. Obviously you must actually know a spell in order to make a potion with that spells effect. Additionally to make use of this talent you must actually have the means to make the potions in the first place such as an alchemist's lab or, for slimes, your own body.


-Alchemy (Final Fantasy IV) (200CP)
        A lack of magic makes you no less useful, and you've learned how to make use of the various potions and other items on a grand scale. You can mix together multiple items, compounding their effects. It doesn't create something new, but instead additively combines the source materials into something with as much potency, to the upper limit of five times the strongest of your source materials.


-Alchemy (Masters of Magic) (200CP)
        While all wizards are capable of converting gold to mana, and vice versa, the process is very inefficient for them, losing half of the value in the process. You can do it perfectly, without any loss, making it potentially feasible for you to power your magic through taxation, for example. In future jumps, this will provide a boost to alchemical abilities, especially those converting one substance into another. You only retain the ability to convert gold to mana (and vice versa) in future jumps if you purchase this ability, which would provide one way to obtain mana in the future.


-Alchemy (Samurai Jack) (200CP)
        The ancient science of mixing specific ingredients and then infusing them with natural energy. You know how to make a wide array of potions with both beneficial and harmful effects.


-Alchemy (Unmodded Minecraft) (200CP)
        You know Minecraft's alchemy recipes front to back, and understand enough of the theory to begin experimenting with the ingredients of this world and others to make new potions. You'll also occasionally get a little more out of your efforts than expected, sometimes getting a free second potion at the end of the distillation process, and rarely a third.


-Alchemy (World of Darkness - Mummy the Resurrection) (200CP)
        The art of alchemy is much, much older than many know. These older alchemists were much less interested in transmuting lead to gold and instead developed a pharmacopeia of drugs, potions, and poisons. You are knowledgeable and skilled in the mundane forms of alchemy, but you are also capable of brewing more impressive supernatural concoctions. From simple tonics to improve one's attributes, to love potions, to philters that grant supernatural protection. You begin knowing only the weakest forms of these but you can improve your alchemical skill and even develop new recipes. Alchemical drugs can be prepared in the form of a classic potion, a salve that must be applied to the skin, or an essence that must be inhaled.


-Dao of Alchemy (Renegade Immortal) (200CP)
        Alchemy is the art and science of using spiritual materials and reagents to create miraculous pills and concoctions with an incredible range of effects. From pills that can heal grievous wounds or cure horrific diseases to poisons so terrifyingly potent that just a single breath can melt the flesh from your bones. Elixirs that induce states of enlightenment or restoratives that can drastically improve your cultivation, help you break through bottlenecks or just simply refill your reserves of spiritual energy when you are low.
        For the less talented, alchemical creations can represent their only hopes to break through to the higher stages of cultivation, be it the Foundation Establishing Pill, the miraculous medicines that can allow for the creation of nascent souls or even stranger things.
        You are an incredibly talented alchemist with an intuitive grasp of the process of pillmaking as well as the way ingredients may interact, allowing you to make leaps in the process of refinement, or even creation of new recipes, that would require years of hard study for others. This kind of talent allows you to easily analyse and recreate pills with a short period of examination.
        Talent isn't everything though. A senior with decades of experience will always do better than a pill genius on their first time. You have the equivalent of a good decade or two of practical experience with alchemy under your belt as well as a wealth of theoretical knowledge. If a reagent or pill has existed on Suzaku or in myth, then it's likely you know of it and the ways that it can be used or otherwise nurtured if it is not yet ready. This knowledge will update itself to include similar disciplines in future jumps.


-Neoalchemist (The Glass Scientists) (200CP)
        Invisibility serums, subtle poisons, superspeed formulae, if the Victorians ever imagined it could be done with chemistry, you can do it.


-Potioneer (Hercules) (200CP)
        There is a lot of magic in this world, and a lot of it takes the form of potions. Which is great for you, as you're now a truly superb potioneer and alchemist. You have a gift for mixing ingredients, enriching them with magic if you need to or just cutting and preparing them just right. You're also brilliant at improving recipes or coming up with new ones, having a gift for these things. Making a potion that turns a god into a mortal is well within your capacities provided the right ingredients, and that's only one potion.


-Slime (Overlord - The Series) (200CP)
        There are many types of slimes and oozes. All of them are uniformly next to impossible to hurt with physical attacks, but are incredibly vulnerable to one type of elemental damage (fire for a regular slime, ice/cold for a lava slime, etc) and also possess a slight weakness to magic in general. You possess the ability to take on a human form that will pass even close inspection, while losing none of the benefits that come with being made up of an amorphous slime-like substance, and possess physical abilities at least twenty times that of a human. Including speed, despite how odd that may seem. You can naturally fit through tight spaces, shape your body into unnatural forms, and can make as many 'feelers' or 'manipulator arms' as you like. In truth you're more like a uniformly colored Shoggoth than you are anything else, except without all the eyes and body parts. Slimes are also powerfully acidic and can inflict grievous acid damage on anything they touch; you naturally possess the ability to determine whether or not your acid will damage the things you are in contact with. All Slimes are naturally good at alchemy and can create alchemical substances and magical potions, if they possess the knowledge of their creation, directly out of their own body. Slimes, due to their nature, are ageless.


-Alchemist (Dishonored 2) (300CP)
        Did you study under Hypatia, the famed alchemist of Addermire? Or perhaps you were from Gristol, and were tutored for some time by Sokolov and Joplin, who famously created the cure for the rat plague more than a decade ago? It matters not. Medicine, botany and chemistry is where your talent lies, and while the 'wet sciences' are not as flashy as those of clockworks or galvanics, there is no end to the utility they can be put to.
        You are a masterful producer of tinctures and remedies, but also poisons and other chemicals that find use in combat, like gunpowder and the ingredients used in explosive projectiles and the Howlers' bombs. You'll be sure to get a lot of customers, whether for your beneficial concoctions, or your baneful ones. You might even surprise yourself with what your mixtures are capable of.


-Alchemy (Castlevania) (300CP)
        Through careful experimentation and research, you've gained understanding of the true nature of God's creation of the world. You may now utilize a lesser form of this art to create items of power, ranging from potions and charms to powerful weapons to drive back the forces of evil. You also understand the basics of a darker form of this art, enabling you to understand and counter evil rituals.


-Alchemy (Gothic) (300CP)
        You can identify local plants and their properties and create magical potions. Healing and mana potions are the most common on the market, but with some unusual ingredients you might be able to create potions that permanently improve the drinker's body. You also know how to brew or distill various alcoholic beverages.


-Alchemy (World of Warcraft) (300CP)
        Mix potions, elixirs, flasks, oils and other alchemical substances into vials using herbs and other reagents. Your concoctions can rejuvenate, enhance attributes, or provide any number of other useful (or not-so-useful) effects. High level alchemists can also transmute essences and metals into other essences and metals. Alchemists can specialize as a Master of Potions, or a Master of Transmutation. Zen Master: At this level you've mastered everything from basics to advanced. Additionally you've expanded your knowledge of the profession beyond the mastery of both basics and advanced stuff to complete understanding of it. At this level you're on even playing field with top 1% of your profession. Should you write down your knowledge it would easily be considered a work of art in that field.


-Alchemy | Mixing Mixtures (Banjo-Kazooie) (300CP)
        Alchemy (100CP)
        You are incredibly capable at mixing together mundane ingredients to create effects that can only be described as magical. For a short time, these potions can create temporary copies of you, turn you invisible, or give you shielding.
        Mixing Mixtures (200CP)
        Your created potions can bestow multiple effects you know, however mixing too many might cause surprises. You can Reliably mix up to a dozen elixirs without them interfering with the effects of each other.


-Blessing of Medicine (Jobless In Another World) (300CP)
        You possess an absolute, innate, and intuitive knowledge of all plants and other organic compounds and what they can be used for in terms of making medicines, poultices, potions, remedies, and so forth. Additionally you automatically qualify as being able to make those things regardless of whether or not you possess the normal class requirements for doing so, and further possess the skills needed to actually make them no matter how complex. Even beyond that you can make things that would otherwise be normally impossible, such as elixirs of immortality (of the agelessness variety) or things like the Limit Breaker potion which would allow you to expand the level limit of a class by up to ten times its normal amount. In future worlds you will easily be able to adapt any recipes you've already discovered to use local ingredients.


-Creation Prodigy (Ar Tonelico) (300CP)
        Grathmeldingis an artificial magic created as a safer alternative to Song Science by the Goddess Eolia. By combining items via ritual alchemical methods with a Grathnode crystal, the immense Silver Horn wrapped around the tower detects the signal emitted and computes a burst of transmutation magic in response. This ranges from creating magic swords, mechanical armour, advanced prosthetics, healing potions, guided missiles, all the way up to airships and extremely powerful emergent creations beyond the knowledge of Eolia herself. You can divine a deeper logic behind the often-bizarre recipes and have much better odds when devising new Recipes. For those who live away from Ar Tonelico, Synthesis is the more scientific form of the same process. You're just as good at this.


-Deranged Alchemist (Van Helsing) (300CP)
        You have mastered the medieval forerunner of chemistry, and know the transformation of matter via elaborate rituals and mysticism on top of your scientific approach. The greatest secrets of Alchemy still elude you, such as the fabled Panacea, but that can be found in due time. (Hint: Nobody's found it. At all.) However, you are capable of transmutation of many materials (although it requires that said materials be the same base) and can create Homunculi from following Paracelsus' studies into alchemy.


-Ingredients' True Potential (Wonderland No More) (300CP)
        There are many magical foods throughout Wonderland, but many of them will not show their full potential unless used by a Gourmancer. You now have a natural knack for detecting potential ingredients (this includes living beings as well) you can use and getting a general idea of both their tastiness and what powers they might offer. If said ingredients have potential uses that wouldn't be normally available, you have greater luck at unlocking their full potential.


-Shamanic Chemist (Clive Barker's Jericho) (300CP)
        As a little boy, your family made sure to pass down the ancient lessons of their family. Shamanism and Alchemy, two parts from each side now united into one student, yourself. You're an expert alchemist and an experienced shaman. Alchemy enables a wide range of potions and substance creation, from fluids that heal injuries and turn lead to gold or which assist with the creation of metals that can harm and bind spirits. A useful thing, given your Shamanism training is all about contacting, summoning, binding and then making use of all kinds of spirits, from the elementals of the earth to the ghosts of the beyond and even, if you want to walk a dangerous path, the demons of the Pyxis. Your training has incidentally given you a pretty in depth knowledge of chemistry, pharmacology and botany too.


-Alchemical Tome (My Little Pony - Friendship Is Magic) (400CP)
        A large book containing hundreds upon hundreds of recipes for magical poultices and potions and it even guides you on how to make your own potions. If purchased multiple times you will have books with rarer and more unique recipes until the fourth purchase which contains a book with merely five recipes, all of them truly legendary in potency.


-Alchemist (The Mighty Boosh) (400CP)
        The final, most powerful skill of the Shamans. The ability to brew potions and craft poultices that can create strange magical effects. While you can make some powerful stuff, up to the level of a pint of Shaman Juice, you still have to deal with the issue of logistics. You need to have the right ingredients on hand, and the right amount of time to brew it properly. Also this perk gives you amazing knowledge regarding how to properly create various kinds of alcohol from different base ingredients.


-Alchemy (Valkyrie Profile) (400CP)
        At its most basic, alchemy is simply the creation of magic concoctions and items with a range of effects, from the mundane, such as healing items and exploding liquids, to the horrifying and illegal, such as the much feared Ghoul Powder that turns the living into mindless demons. From there, many alchemists learn the difficult and resource intensive formula for altering one material into another, and that's where their knowledge ends. But the true potential of alchemy is that it holds the ability to manipulate life, much like necromancy manipulates the dead. With the right knowledge, an alchemist can experiment and create horrible monsters and abominations, even imbuing them with magic and other mystical abilities, or even create a perfect simulacra of a human. The one thing outside of Alchemy's power is the creation of souls, so their creations may be alive or even think, but they don't truly feel the way a natural creature would. There's nothing preventing an alchemist with knowledge of other disciplines from transferring a soul into an empty vessel, however. On the other hand, there is much more to alchemy that nobody has yet uncovered, and further research can uncover further uses of alchemy.


-Berserum (Smash Up) (400CP)
        You know all about various improvements to nature, a veritable cornucopia of drugs to enhance combat ability. Drugs to remove the need for rest, to harden flesh to stone, for alertness and overpowering strength and maybe the development of psychic powers! It's all very exciting.


-Citrinitas (Lords of the Night - Zombies) (400CP)
        You can now create alchemical engines like your own Kindling flame, a physical transformation that establishes an immaterial alchemical flame inside something that then fuels further transformations. This can be used to create constructs or solid state systems that behave like mechanical systems. Yes, there are mechanical computers, and yes, such systems can be impossibly good - the alchemical equivalent of a clockwork soldier. This perk explicitly plays well with other creation and crafting abilities you have, including Albedo. The Alchemical Flames these engines are built out of are fueled by Silver, Gold, and the very fires of life. Corpus works too. It may be possible to work with other supernatural fuels, but unless it's something like the power cosmic or Quintessence, it will require significant work to adapt.


-Essence Distillation (Generic Universal Monsters) (400CP)
        Lesser minds scoff at the idea that science can affect the soul. You know better. You have learned to brew a concoction that will draw forth all the evil in a person. Allowing it to overwhelm other personality traits and indulge in their dark desires without restraint. You're most of the way to creating a similar situation for goodness as well and proper research will allow you to do the same with other character traits, brewing liquid courage or objectivity in a bottle. While under the effect of one of these drugs, a person's appearance will change, often into a body which seems to radiate the enhanced quality.


-Milkshake! (Make A Wish) (400CP)
        You are a prodigy at making potions, capable of preparing any type of exotic ingredients and making potions that give nightmares to even experienced masters, you have knowledge of many potions made in this world and change them to taste like strawberry milkshake or any other flavour you like, you have a knack for learning new recipes, modifying old recipes to work with new ingredients and creating new potions wholesale with creatures out of this world. You also have the less regarded ability to mix cooking talent and knowledge of chemistry with your potion making, which makes your potion making linked with cooking knowledge and chemistry.


-Transmutation/Alchemy (Fate/) (400CP)
        There exist many special arts within magecraft, and now you have gained the knowledge of one of them. There are many schools of magic to specialize in, such as Alchemy, Memory Partition, Thought Acceleration, Transmutation, Jewelcraft, Curses etc. You could even learn the Emiya art of Time Manipulation, though you will have only the very basics, and will need years just to get to Kiritsugu's level, but you may possibly go even further. You may not choose any True Magic with this perk. This perk can be bought multiple times


-Sburb Starter Kit | Alchemization (SBURB) (500CP)
Sburb Starter Kit (100CP)
        Don't feel like upgrading your Sylladex to drag your equipment back to your interdimensional warehouse? That's okay! This upgrade equips your warehouse with a Cruxtruder, Punch Designex, Totem Lathe, and Alchemiter! Now you have some extra ones,and you don't have to rob the you of this life's house. If you want any other upgrades, you'll have to make them yourself. You should be able to do that from your warehouse now though.
        (Note: Purchasing this Cruxtruder and opening it for the first time will not give you another)
Alchemization (400CP)
        Alchemization is strange business, creating punch cards, double punching and overlapping them to combine items into entirely new items. It's quite an amazing process, but sometimes unpredictable, and without care you could end up with exceptionally silly results. You however, are something else. The moment you get access to an Alchemitter, you will be the most fashionable and deadly kid in paradox space. All of the style will belong to you. In addition to instinctively knowing how to find the best combinations for outfits, weapons, and such things, you'll find it also easy to make useful tools such as a Captaroid Camera, to use things in alchemy without having to actually put it into a sylladex. Handy if you want to duplicate your brain, or something too large to fit. In general, if alchemizing something is possible, you'll be able to think of a way to do it.


-Alchemical Expertise (eXceed) (600CP)
        Alchemy is the ancient art of drawing power from mystic artifacts. Unlike some variations of it you may have seen already, its core principle is imbuement and extraction.
        First, one must select an object with a useful quality, then they must understand this object fully through study. Then, through this understanding, one may refine this quality into a free-floating concept. This concept may then be applied to a useful vessel, which will benefit from such.
        For example, one may learn all that there is about a fighter jet, to the point of being capable of explaining everything about it and its operation and function with absolute certainty no matter what circumstances befall it. Then, one may reduce this particular jet to its Flight alone. One could then add its Flight to a suit of armor. An alchemist could then tap into the concept of Flight within it to soar.
        One could do the same to an industrial electromagnetic order to acquire the concept of Magnetic Attraction, or even a living being in order to acquire the concept of Self-Replication. However, one may only bind two concepts to any given object, and they may not be removed once set.


-Alchemy (World of Darkness - Sorcerer) (600CP)
        Alchemy - This path allows the sorcerer to create potions, chemicals, and materials with supernatural qualities. Not all users think of themselves as alchemists, and may insist on being referred to as herbalists or simply skilled chemists.
        [1] The alchemist may create more advanced versions of mundane chemicals, such as painkillers and glue. They are not overtly supernatural, and can easily be passed off as just a better brand.
        [2] All that the first dot offered and more. The alchemist can create short lived steroids and potions that grant mystical senses for short periods.
        [3] The alchemist's enhancements can now create mildly superhuman physical abilities and grant low level psychic powers, at least for short periods. They can also create materials and alloys that surpass what should be possible.
        [4] More potent versions of what is available at 3 dots.
        [5] With great study - or a sample - of a supernatural creature, the alchemist may replicate their various mid-level abilities for short periods. More potent abilities come with side effects.
        [6] At this level, an alchemist may create such miracles as the Elixir of Eternal Youth, or even induce an Awakening.
        Alchemy Rituals
        One dot: A powder that, when mixed with alcohol, induces sleep almost instantly or a pill that suppresses the symptoms of the common cold or flu for a full day and halves recovery time.
        Two dots: A form of LSD that grants vague but accurate visions of the future or a drug that doubles running speed for up to an hour, but leaves those with low stamina shaky and out of breath for the next.
        Three dots: A metal alloy that is lighter and stronger than titanium, but easier to work with, can retain an edge almost forever, and stays more resilient than the finest blade,or a metallic dust that reveals hidden, disguised, or invisible things for what they are, disrupting illusions.
        Four dots: A chemical that raises physical abilities for up to eight hours, possibly even to superhuman levels. Side effects include an insatiable appetite during this period. Another option is a regiment of drugs that slows down the aging process to one twelfth its natural speed.
        [5] A potion of this magnitude allows its drinker to match the physical abilities of a vampire for an hour.
        [5] A pungent substance that is especially disgusting to werewolves, to the point where none dare come within five feet of whatever it is smeared upon. Anyone else with a sense of smell will also be reluctant to do so, but not to the same extent.


-Alchemy Mondays (I Saved Too Many Girls And Caused The Apocalypse) (600CP)
        The ancient, and basically lost, study of alchemy. Not even in the ranks of the hidden mages of Earth can you find someone who knows much of it, well, outside you, of course. Your family was actually one of the last (if not the last) practitioners of this field of study, leaving you with vast knowledge and resources to explore it. What's more, you possess an incredible raw talent for this field of study, making the secrets of this lost art an open book to you. With some effort and little time, you will be able to reproduce the great feats of alchemy, like transmuting lead into gold or creating a Panacea that can cure all ailments. Not even the Philosopher's Stone is out of reach.


-Brain of the Moon (Touhou Forbidden Hermit) (600CP)
Did you study under Eirin? Like her, you can make a drug to perfectly cure any possible disease, make drugs that could manipulate the Dream World, and likely produce even more fantastical effects. This does have a few limitations, you cannot create a drug that does the impossible, you can’t cure something you do not know or understand, and you cannot make drugs without base ingredients. Perhaps if you found someone who could manipulate eternity itself you could even replicate the Hourai Elixir. This does not come with any raw materials, but you will also find ways to substitute the raw materials of other worlds for anything you could have found here.
-Dark Science (9 Jumpchain) (600CP)
        You are familiar with the principles of alchemy, or 'Dark Science', which led to the creation of the Stitchpunks, The Machine, and the end of humanity. This knowledge lets you create devices which can interact with the mind and soul. This includes the one The Scientist used to copy his Intellect onto the Machine's core, as well as the one he used to gift fractions of his soul upon the Stitchpunks, not to mention how to properly prepare a core or homunculus to accept such things. It should be noted that homunculi with partial souls will have very exaggerated personalities, and creations imbued with pure intellect will be lacking a soul and the emotions that come with it.


-Darkbrew Traditions (Dota 2) (600CP)
        Chymistry, otherwise known as alchemy, is your forte. Simple transmutation such as breaking silver down into copper or lead into tin are rather easy, you having discovered the secrets to brewing the required liquids for the reactions to occur with great safety and speed, and more basic brews such as healing draughts which vastly accelerate cellular division and potent acids able to break down living matter and metal alike are also known to you.
        Generally speaking, transmutation turns like into like, while direct concoctions perform feats the common folk would liken to regular chemistry enhanced by magic. How true that may or may not be is generally ignored by Smallkeen, as the art is incredibly useful for scientific research and the cultural hatred of magic would foul many promising leads. Whether or not you are a member of the Darkbrew family is your choice, and any particular goals regarding mountains and transmutation of gold are your own to decide.


-Equivalent Exchange (Minecraft) (600CP)
        You are a powerful Alchemist, able to infuse a Diamond with the power of Redstone and Glowstone to make a Philosopher's Stone. With such a stone in hand, you'll be able to create a Transmutation Tablet, allowing you to instantly convert matter from one form to another, possibly even converting ordinary dirt to valuable Diamonds... or even compressing the Diamonds further into Dark Matter or Red Matter.
        Combining your transmutation skills with these exotic and vastly expensive forms of matter, you'll be able to produce Alchemical Chests with incredible volume, indestructible equipment with immense power, energy collector systems to generate additional resources from nothingness, and potentially become nearly immortal, burning vast quantities of resources instead of taking wounds.
        Your powers are all incredibly expensive to use, and you won't be able to max them out in your time here (especially if you don't have any advantages in harvesting resources!), but the raw potential of this path exceeds all others.


-Master Synthesist (Kingdom Hearts) (600CP)
        To make a sword you normally need metal, a tool to shape it, and a forge to heat the metal. Not you though, you can take strange and esoteric materials and magically combine them into a health potion, or a ring that increases your durability.
        Once you've gotten the hang of it you'll be able to turn the rare materials you've collected into powerful items, weapons that can turn the tide of many a battle. A few examples are making arrowguns that shoot homing laser arrows and can combine to fire a giant bouncing blast, a stringed instrument that can make water dance to your tune to form aqueous duplicates to attack with, or even a deck of cards than can temporarily trap the loser of a game of chance in card form.
        The greatest expressions of this craft, Save the King, Save the Queen, and the Ultima Weapon, will require years of experience, and some resources so rare you'll be lucky to find enough even if you scour all the worlds you can. The rarity and power of the materials used will impact the final quality and properties of the finished product.


-Trigram Knowledge and Manipulation (Journey to the West) (600CP)
        Alchemy and matter manipulation with the understanding of the 8 trigrams to represent the fundamental forces of reality and how to represent and enforce change using these. Let me break this one down for you. It's like FMA alchemy but with less focus on direct creation and more turning one thing into another of a similar size, including living things. However it cannot create life where there once was none and it requires you to write out a short formula describing the change to make it happen. Feel free to turn sand into water, sheep into boulders and anything else you can think of.


-Tinkerer | The God-Catching Alchemy Meister (God Catching Alchemy Meister) (700CP)
Tinkerer (100CP)
        Many believe that alchemy is just mixing up random things to make potions or hit a lump of iron until it becomes a steel sword. They don't know the truth. Alchemists like you need several skills to get their license: starting with blacksmithing to create weapons and armor, chemistry and herbalism to mix potions that work, anatomy of both monsters and people so they can loot properly and their creations don't end up causing harm to the users, different forms of art to cater to the clients; mineralogy and even some basic knowledge of magic, for enchanting their works. You are decently trained in all these skills, which are the basis for any alchemist to thrive in society.
The God-Catching Alchemy Meister (600CP)
        When someone asks a kid what an alchemist is, they think of a great creator that takes leaves and lumps of iron, making them into elixirs and legendary weapons. Indeed, when someone asks a kid what an alchemist is, they think of you. Because your skill, insight and experience are enough to challenge the most esteemed alchemists in this land and come out victorious.
        Your creations ooze creativity, shown as they need far less materials than normal and your skill is enough to do them in less time and have far superior products compared to any other alchemist here. From accessories that make the user immune to some element, trinkets that allow for teleportation or the more direct weapons that can cause an instant death in the victims. Furthermore, your talent hasn't weaned at all, and you still see room for improvement in your works. You're one that could take the precious title of 'Meister', if not aim ever higher.


-Alchemical Formulae (Generic Sugar Bowl) (800CP)
        Woah nelly! You could do a lot with this sort of power! Besides being able to make just about any kind of potion you can think of (nothing to make you completely invulnerable, though), you can even make a new living creature, with the right ingredients. You'll need three flowers for its skin, hair, and eye colors (or two coat colors and an eye color), some clay for the body, some sugar for energy, some spice for depth of personality, and an ingredient for each personality trait you want them to have, up to eight main ones. Now, this ritual does take a month or two, and you have to hand-pick each ingredient. What's more, you need enough clay to actually sculpt a body of the size you want to make.


-Alchemist | Formula Formulator (Secrets of Evermore) (800CP)
        Alchemist (200CP)
        Considered a lost art, the science of Alchemy has reawakened in Evermore, and you've been trained in its use. By combining ordinary ingredients together using an alchemical formula, you can transform them into effects that can only be described as magic. You know both Light Alchemy, the art of healing or protection, and Dark Alchemy, the art of attacking. While it's theoretically possible to learn Alchemy at a later point in Evermore, this will let you skip the training and get straight to the mixing and casting, and will make you significantly better at it to boot.
        Formula Formulator (600CP)
        Learning new alchemical formulas is pretty easy once you've got the basics down. You, on the other hand, can do something much more difficult, and much more impressive. With careful experimentation and tinkering, you can create your own formulas, allowing you to unleash entirely new alchemical effects nobody's ever seen before. Stronger or more useful effects will generally require rarer ingredients, and they usually need to relate to the effect in some metaphorical way, but as long as you keep those rules in mind you'll be coming up with new alchemy in no time.


-Mist Alchemy | Core Artificer | Refined Ichor | Mist Collector | Harvester | Lens Mastery (Nexus 2.0) (900CP)
        Mist Alchemy (100CP)
        Mist has more uses than simply being used to create Mistlight Manifestations, the most common form is Mist Alchemy, imbuing Mist into a material to subtly alter its properties. This is a minor boon, imbuing heat aligned Mist into metal might prevent it from forming stress fractures during quenching or remove the need for tempering, while imbuing an herb with life aligned Mist might make it better suited to making a healing poultice. Minor things that, combined together, can provide useful results.
        This is commonly used for making simple conveniences or simple tricks, such as pots or pans that more evenly distribute and hold heat or musical instruments that carry their tune farther than normal, rather than proper enhancements. Though medicine enhanced in this way is fairly potent.
        As this skill can be learned in jump, this perk allows you to synergize the traits of wisps of Mist used for Mist Alchemy to achieve greater effects and gives you an innate intuition for how a wisp of Mist will affect an object when imbued in various ways. This stacks with the Mist Affinity perk.
        Core Artificer (200CP)
        A surprisingly rare item to be found in Nexus is the Core, a metal, stone, or wood sphere imbued with Mist and possessing carved 'instructions' in the form of various patterns and runes. Cores are used as a way to give greater flexibility to someone's use of Light for Seed Sorcery. The Mist within the Core can be used as an external lens that rapidly shifts the Light within a Seed towards its own traits, changing a Seed to match its alignment within seconds (if already blank) or just over a minute (if already colored in another way). You know how to create such Cores. Do note, however, that this requires a good deal of Mist to accomplish, and it needs to be strong before it is imbued into a Core or it will provide minimal results. As this skill can be learned in jump, this perk allows you to power Cores with powers other than Seed Sorcery and you are capable of creating Cores that are not spheres, or are even another item entirely, such as a sword.
        Refined Ichor (400CP)
        This small jug is filled with the refined ichor of a hacker. Worth its weight in gold, this substance is useful for a number of purposes. Most commonly, it is used alongside Mist Alchemy in enhancing a material or object or to directly enhance the effects of Mist Alchemy. Further refinement turns it into essence, which can temporarily boost one's Light as if they'd cracked a blank seed or it can be mixed with other substances to give a minor increase in Light, this is an incredibly small boost, but is noticeable. It can also be used in manipulating Mist, making refinement more precise, improving cultivation results, and making smelting easier. Finally, it can be used to enhance the innate physical ability of the user, though how this is done is only known by the demons of the Border Ring. There may be other uses, but they are largely unknown.
        Mist Collector (0CP)
        When any creature with Light dies, they leave behind a small echo, a wisp of glittering Mist, colored similarly to the Lenses the individual possessed in life. These wisps are also touched by the memories and emotions of the being's life, altering its properties somewhat. The collection and manipulation of these wisps of Mist are the basis on which Mistlight Manifestations come into existence.
        Collecting a wisp of Mist is easy, simply touching it will stabilize it and allow it to be stored indefinitely. But utilizing a single wisp of Mist to create a Mistlight Manifestation will result in a lackluster Manifestation, weak enough that even humans, who lack the reserves of light necessary to become proper hunters, prefer to make at least a few modifications before doing so. To that end, there are three methods of strengthening a wisp.
        First is smelting or fusing. Taking two or more wisps of Mist and combining them into a single, new one with the traits of both. This is by far the easiest and fastest method of empowering a wisp of Mist. However, unless you know exactly what your wisps of Mist are and how they'll react, combining them in this way may lead to complications, such as opposing traits canceling out or mutating into a new trait that has a negative impact on the whole.
        Second is cultivation. By 'feeding' a wisp of Mist, it is allowed to grow organically and produce new qualities and traits over time. Allowing a wisp of Mist to grow in this way is fairly simple, and with its organic growth it's unlikely to have any complications, but this process is time consuming, potentially taking weeks or months to yield the results on par with smelting or refinement.
        Lastly is refinement. This is a rather difficult process that removes unwanted traits from a wisp of Mist, much like cutting and polishing a gem. This process has you excise traits and qualities from a wisp of Mist, allowing the other aspects to grow in strength as a result. This is a quick process and is unlikely to cause any real trouble, but you must be very precise and careful during the process or you may leave behind bits of what you wanted removed.
        Additionally, wisps of Mist are useful for another purpose. By binding a wisp to a Seed, it can act as an artificial Lens in the use of Seed Sorcery. Seeds formed with a wisp are, however, slower to grow than those that use your own Lenses. Cracking a Seed with a wisp will often cause the wisp to dissipate, though some Seed Sorcerer's have learned how to reclaim the wisp used for this prior to cracking the Seed.
        Harvester (100CP)
        You know a somewhat uncommon technique known as Harvesting, a process by which someone extracts a wisp of Mist from a still living being. This is not damaging, per se, but can put stress on the mind, body, and Light of the one having this done to them. Fighters will sometimes use this to get an edge if they can find an opening to pull it off. It is possible to pull wisps of Mist from yourself with this technique, but it requires a large amount of focus to accomplish without failing. You are able to reclaim wisps used in Seed Sorcery. As this technique can be learned in jump, paying for it makes it more effective, reducing the necessary focus and allowing you to use more advanced forms of harvesting, such as causing greater levels of fatigue with each wisp pulled from an individual or to temporarily empower your Light by consuming the resulting wisp of Mist.
        Lens Mastery (100CP)
        Lenses tint Light towards their own alignment, and using them together is a matter of experimentation to get the desired results. Sapphire goblins find this far more intuitive, able to carefully manage their Seeds with ease, as if each seed had their full attention, easily sliding lenses between Seeds to create a desired result.


-Synthesis: Rank 3 | Efficiency: Rank 1 (Atelier: Arland Trilogy) (1000CP)
        Synthesis (400CP)
        Synthesis is the most basic art of the alchemist and deals with the creation of items, usually through simple mixing, though sometimes synthesis can be a complex sequence of magical and chemical reactions. All alchemists learn this to some degree.
        Seeing as you're an alchemist, the synthesis of items should really be second nature to you. That being said, even if you're already an expert, there's nothing saying that you don't have room to improve further. Also there is no reason why we can't help you improve, if you're willing to put in the effort to learn.
        Rank 0: The basics of synthesis, learning how to make basic potions and food without proper ingredients is still pretty helpful. Sure, you won't be making anything high quality anytime soon, but at least you can make something safely edible from refuse material. It still won't be good for you, but it won't kill you.
        Rank 1: Don't like the looks of what you've made? No matter, just give it a makeover! You can substitute the appearance of what you've made with something else similar to it in nature. Of course, appearances are exactly that, so don't expect the function of your item to change.
        Rank 2: Enhancing what is already present, the items that you create will often possess some small trait related to its original function, generally acting as a sort of minor boost. The nature of the trait will never go against the intended purpose of the item; a potion that normally heals health may also help recover a small bit of your magic.
        Rank 3: Practice makes perfect, and you're still a long ways away from perfect. Each time you make that same item, the quality of the product increases, resulting in increased magnitude of the intended effects. Though the gains will diminish the more you create a single item, you'll find that by the time you reach the plateau you'll have nearly twice the original effect.
        Efficiency (600CP)
        As you grow in your skills as a crafter, you'll start to see more and more requests being handed your way. Before long, you're going to realize that you don't have all the time in the world to make everything that is requested of you, and that's when it becomes all the more important to complete your assignments efficiently.
        Efficiency isn't just a matter of time management, it's about managing waste, reducing redundancies, and above all improving yourself. Yes, you'll learn how to reduce the amount of wasteful choices you have to make but should you apply yourself to this, there's a lot more to efficiency than what you'll learn by scratching the surface. All it depends on is whether you're disciplined enough to follow through.
        Rank 0: As advertised, you'll learn how to reduce the amount of waste produced during your crafting process. Achieving a 1:1 conversion will not be possible with this alone, but being able to turn the waste product into a desired product can go a long way to making synthesis more manageable.
        Rank 1: if you can use less of an item, you won't need to make as much. The effect of any item that you craft is increased slightly from its original magnitude, and their durations are again increased slightly. It will take you a little longer than usual to create items but that's an acceptable sacrifice.


-Simple | Advanced | Alkahestry | Truth (Fullmetal Alchemist) (1300CP)
        Simple (100CP)
        You understand the connections between parts. You can make large alchemy circles far more easily and far less complex than others. You can combine this with Advanced Formulae for multipurpose combat alchemy.
        Advanced (100CP)
        Alchemy comes to you as easily as breathing does. Your greater understanding allows you to perform more complex alchemy. You can combine this with Simplified Formulae for multipurpose combat alchemy.
        Alkahestry (300CP)
        You understand how to perform basic Alkahestry, an art from Xing which can perform transmutation from a distance using linked circles, and can heal wounds of many kinds by following the pulse of the body. With practice or tutoring you can make a real skill from it.
        Truth (800CP)
        Choose to lose either of the four. Your voice, your dominant hand, Your non-dominant arm, or your dominant arm. In return you gain the ability to perform alchemy without a transmutation circle and your knowledge of the science is expanded to the point where you have effectively mastered both simple and advanced Formulae.


-Plasmids Are The Paint | Veni Vidi Vigor | Gatherer's Garden | Adam Slugs (Bioshock 2 + Bioshock Infinite) (1500CP)
        Plasmids Are The Paint (300CP)
        ADAM flowed through every vein in Rapture to some degree. Plasmids were a force that could sway the entire economy with each new formula released. Suchong and Tenenbaum were certainly the two spearheading development, but they were not the only ones. There was an entire field of geneticists tinkering in their labs on how best to mix the human genome like a cocktail. You were one of these minds. You have a decade of practical experience playing and modifying genetics, but are particularly skilled when it comes to creating Plasmids and Tonics. While you are by no means a world-changing genius like the two greats previously mentioned, you are more than capable of creating your own ADAM-based products given a lab and supply of the substance. What you do with this knowledge is entirely up to you.
        Veni Vidi Vigor (600CP)
        You know how to create Vigors having access to the formula and having witnessed the process. You know how to create 3 Vigors currently in existence and you are in a unique position to design and create your own through experimentation. Your experiments with ADAM are guaranteed to lack negative side-effects.
        Gatherer's Garden (400CP)
        My daddy's SMARTER than Einstein, STRONGER than Hercules and lights a fire with a SNAP of his fingers. Are you as good as my daddy, Mister? This rather cheerful little vending machine will advertise the Plasmids and Tonics inside with the voice of a little girl and a merry melody or two. Unlike other vending machines, this one doesn't use money, but requires vials of ADAM instead. This one comes stocked with virtually every Plasmid and Tonic Rapture has to offer and never seems to need restocking, but caveat emptor. These ones come with the usual range of side effects that plagued the citizens of the city. So make sure you limit how often people use it or have a steady supply of ADAM on hand. Unless you want to create wild Splicers.
        Adam Slugs (200CP)
        Ugly as they are, these deep sea slugs glow with the bright red of ADAM in their veins. They naturally produce the raw material, which can be harvested from them and easily refined into the necessary building blocks for Plasmids and Tonics. However, harvesting the slugs directly yields very little ADAM and would require dozens to generate a single new Plasmid. But it is what it is. It's not like you would implant them in little girls and then harvest their blood for larger amounts of ADAM. That would be monstrous. The slugs come in a small aquarium that won't need maintenance to keep them alive and will refill to contain six slugs every week. Just keep the lid on. They like to wander.

-Battle-Ready Bathrobes (Elder Scrolls Online) (100CP)
        The title of "clothier" is misleading. Rather than being a simple seamstress, it's more accurate to say that a clothier specializes in making subtle but protective light armor that can easily transition from the ballroom to the battlefield and durable yet flexible medium-weight armors that are adored by scouts and survivalists during long treks. You now have that set of skills, able to craft any armor up to Rank Five (Ebonthread and Fellhide) and refine it with tannins. In time, you may be able to expand your skills further, perhaps even learning to sing-weave ancestor silk from the Moth Priests themselves.


-Costumer (Terraria - Journey's End) (100CP)
        Many objects, especially with regards to armor, place function over form. Now, you don't have to settle for armor that is good but an eyesore. You can take any item you possess and 'overlay' it on top of a similar item, changing the second item's appearance to match the first, while maintaining all of its functionality, protective qualities, etc.


-Needlework (Earth Girls) (100CP)
        It wouldn't really be called tailoring, but that's basically what you do. Making thread and basic cloth from scratch, fashioning fur and leather into clothes, and fixing up all the rips and tears the others get running around. The clothing you make is always rugged and neatly made, too.


-Arachne Silk (Monster Girl Encyclopedia) (200CP)
        An endless strand of silk from an Arachne that can be used in making clothes. Clothes made with the silk are extra durable, so that even a wild beast couldn't leave even a tear on them. Stains on the cloth are easy to remove, but magical energies applied to the clothes have a trace of them absorbed and stored inside the clothes, giving off the scent of the energy.


-Putting on the Reich (Indiana Jones) (200CP)
        They may fear your tenacity. They may hate your cause. They may even oppose your beliefs. But one thing remains constant: A begrudging respect for the aura of organization and sharpness you give off. You have an excellent sense of how to design uniforms that are not only intimidating and show the power of your group, but are also fashionable and make your group look organized, official in a way. It's time to show them who's Boss.


-Secular Skills (Red Dwarf) (200CP)
        Through growing up in a society in which religion tried to stem the natural instincts of the cat people towards vanity and good looks, you learned to craft amazing clothes and outfits from the most basic materials and tools, and don't worry they will all look fantastic.


-Spinning Wheel of Arachne (Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 2) (200CP)
        Taking the form of an old spinning wheel with webs and spiders nesting inside the circle, this relic is a testament to the skill of those who would dare challenge the gods themselves. The spiders within eternally produce silk that is as glamorous as it is tough, letting one weave with a thread that never allows itself to be torn or ripped by normal, mundane means such as fist or blade. In addition, any fabric you attempt to feed the spiders will soon have its traits mixed with the silk, making the spiders create something marvelous.


-The Arachnid's Needle (Exalted - The Solars) (200CP)
        The Solar Exaltation was born in the crucible of revolution, intended as a primordial weapon of mass destruction. Yet the peerless artifice of the Great Maker coupled with the perfection of Ignis Divine led to something far more potent. Once the drums of war finally ended their beat, and the fallen titans locked away, many of the chosen found new ways to express their power during peacetime. These new god-kings saw the arts flourish at their hand, the perfection of their essence allowing the creation of unparalleled masterpieces. One such remnant of these lost arts is this needle, created from the spinneret of a titanic primordial behemoth and alloyed with orichalcum. Such a tool was used in the first age to weave some of the finest garments of its time, producing such wonders as a dress woven of crystal and glass, or a suit created from molten rock; thanks to its potent magic, almost any material can be worked with. Its exploits have been known for millennia, and such constant use has left it with an imprint of its former owner's genius. As such, even the lowliest of craftsmen can create exquisite garments should they wield this needle.
        * The imprint of former owner should know how to make stuff with essence which seems useful


-Profession: Tailoring (World of Warcraft) (300CP)
        Sew cloth armor and many kinds of bags using dye, thread and cloth gathered from humanoid enemies during your travels. Tailors can also fashion nets to slow enemies with, rideable flying carpets, and magical threads which empower items they are stitched into. Zen Master: At this level you've mastered everything from basics to advanced. Additionally you've expanded your knowledge of the profession beyond the mastery of both basics and advanced stuff to complete understanding of it. At this level you're on an even playing field with top 1% of your profession. Should you write down your knowledge it would easily be considered a work of art in that field.


-Stitch by Stitch (Earth Girls) (300CP)
        The clothes you make are gorgeous and suited to the person you make them for. They protect both the heart and the body of the person that wears them, sheltering them from physical sickness and 'spiritual' illnesses alike while making the most of their body.


-Ambient Magic: Thread (Circle of Magic) (400CP)
        Ambient magic takes different forms depending on the mage and the craft he or she performs. Each Ambient Magic is considered linked to a specific one of the four elements. There are a multitude of different forms of ambient magic, each linked to ages old traditions such as (but not limited to) cooking, dancing, smithing, weaving, animal tending, sailing, building, gardening, farming, and scribing; or to powerful natural forces, such as fire, wind, weather, and so on.
        Thread: A form of Earth Magic, it allows the manipulation and enhancement of thread, cloth, and other tools of the weaver or sewer's trade. It is practiced by Sandry and Dedicate Lark. Stitch Witches can enchant bandages to heal wounds, broider veils to hide identities, make clothes that protect like armor or ward away fire, and sew good luck or love charms.


-Incredibly Talented (In Another World With My Smartphone) (400CP)
        There is one area in which you truly shine. Pick a single skill or talent such as hand to hand, swordsmanship, magical innovation, alchemy, or similar focus. You are now, hands down, one of the best people in the world in that subject. An alchemist could come up with all sorts of new alchemical concoctions and potions that would astound and amaze your peers, a swordsman could cut down a hundred men on his own nearly effortlessly, a magical innovator could create new spells or rituals or magical items with unsurpassed vision and creativity, and similar such potency applies to any other skill or focus you take with this perk. Beyond that however you will always be able to refine your focus, allowing you to push yourself to greater and greater heights no matter how skilled you become. You may purchase this perk more than one, but it must apply to a new skill or focus each time it is taken.
        * Its a uncapper which is pretty unique and nice


-Log In Room (The Weakness Of Beatrice) (400CP)
        A room connected to your warehouse or a property that you own that seems very similar to the login room you see on entrance to Grounds' Nir, where you would normally equip your Percentage type Gear and customise your colours. This room accomplishes the same thing, providing limitless storage for all your clothing and allowing you to instantly fit on any clothing you own. It can also freely change the colours of any clothing you own as well.
        While it cannot create clothing from nothing, it does have two powerful effects. The first, it can turn existing clothes into Percentage Type Gear, giving it percentage based stat boosts that increase depending on how powerful the gear is, usually relating to the gears original purpose.
        The second, it allows you to combine existing pieces of clothing into a single piece of gear, combining their effects and appearance. Be warned that Percentage Gear requires you to have enough Willpower to handle it and making something into too strong a Gear piece may result in you being unable to equip it and gain the effects. Clothing made via this room or modified is made from Willpower, allowing you to instantly shed or reequip whatever you are currently wearing even outside of the room.


-Sewing Room (Twokinds) (400CP)
        Just as a cook needs a kitchen and a mage needs a laboratory, a seamstress needs a sewing room! This cozy space contains every tool you'll need to craft beautiful garments and functional clothing. This workshop also comes with a wide variety of fabrics, fasteners, and other supplies you'll need to complete your crafts. Even rare and exotic materials, like drake leather and wyvernsilk, are included in your stockpile.


-Smart Clothing (Eclipse Phase) (400CP)
        Comprised of programmable fibres, Smart Clothing can alter its shape, cut, style and colour to mimic nearly any outfit, from Tron-like bodysuits with animated glowing panels, to a formal tux complete with tails, flower on the lapel and a handkerchief in the pocket, to going partially or totally transparent in case you wanted to show off your nanotats while working in outer space it's just a matter of programming in a new style. However, the smart clothing remains all one piece no matter how many parts it looks like it has, and making it look like armour or a radiation suit doesn't afford any more protection than its (moderately tough) fibres already do.
        Smart Clothing can be combined with an outfit you already own for free, such as your free Light Vacsuit, upgrading it to a Smart Fabric Vac Suit. As you have chosen to upgrade, your suit has all the extra features. The clothing is very heavily armored against both kinetic and energy attacks (easily shrugging off small calibre rounds or a laser pistol), and has a whole host of defensive modifications that make different attack modes (like laser, flame and acid) far less effective. The colour-shifting pattern can give you active camouflage and thermal signature dampening at a moment's notice, and you can even electrically shock anyone in contact with you.
        * Smart fabric Vac Suit is essentially a high tech space suit


-Tailor Made | Resolute Thread (Skulduggery Pleasant) (400CP)
Tailor Made (200CP)
        You have the knowledge of how to weave magic into clothes, making them incredibly durable and protective. They're capable of protecting the wearer from most things, including bullets, knives, magic, extreme heat, and large amounts of blunt-force trauma. They also look damn stylish.
Resolute Thread (200CP)
        You have a spool of thread that's supposedly made from the stomach lining of an Emperor Dragon over 2000 years ago. The more pressure applied to it, the stronger it becomes. You could bind a superhuman or use it to hang hundreds of tons off of the ground. Spool refills and used thread once a month.


-The Flock's Fleece (Actraiser) (400CP)
        Men and women have not wandered the wilds naked since the long-gone days of the Garden. Whether they knew it or not, the act of clothing oneself is one that at once protects and isolates. A shirt or a robe is a metaphorical armor against the elements, against shame and against the prying eyes of others. You are such a skilled craftsman that you can take the 'metaphorical' part out of the equation. You're a one-person clothing creator and tailor, able to take the raw materials of silk, cotton, wool and hide...and then with almost no tools produce wondrous clothing, fitted just right for anyone who dares try the garments on. They're protective vestments against the harsh elements, able to keep people in comfortable condition be they in the deserts of Kasandora or the icy plains of Northwall. Not only that, but people who wear them find that they'll be kept safer from the claws of beasts or the swords of their enemies, acting as a light chain-mail mesh despite being soft and maneuverable fabric.


-Requiem of Souls | Weaver | Silk Spinning (Jade Cocoon) (500CP)
        Requiem of Souls (200CP)
        You have been taught the sacred song of the Cocoon Masters, which allows you to soothe a Minion's raging heart. By playing this song to a weakened monster, you can capture it inside of an empty cocoon. The more damaged the creature is, and the more skillful your playing, the more likely you are to capture it. You can play the song again to release them, but by itself the Requiem will not make them loyal to you. This gives you basic proficiency in a musical instrument of your choice.
        Weaver (100CP)
        You are now an expert weaver. Doesn't sound like much, right? Remember that the silk spun from magical creatures' cocoons was so beautiful that King Karis murdered his own son over it. They have some REALLY good silk here in Parel is what I'm saying and you are a master of working with it.
        Silk Spinning (200CP)
        With a prayer to Elhrim, you can purify a Firefly Cocoon (a cocoon filled with a monster using the Requiem of Souls perk above) and spin it into silk. This kills the monster but produces truly breathtaking silk. The stronger the monster, the better quality of silk is produced. The strongest Minions could produce silk fit for a god. Who knows what you could make from the monsters you might find out there on distant worlds?


-Industry Support (My Hero Academia) (600CP)
        Every hero currently running around out there has a costume of some kind like a full body badge, and equipment that complements their style or Quirk incredibly. Where did you think all that came from?
        When it comes to a career in support, it doesn't matter if no one has heard of you before, you're easily a top dog in the industry. Costumes and equipment alike are your forte and nobody can deny.
        Your costumes are form fitting, flattering, stylish and sturdy, easily standing up to the day in day out beating and stress that those who wear them put them through while keeping them looking amazing. More importantly, you're a flat out genius when it comes to this world's technology, making the various gadgets, machines and equipment that can take an okay Quirk to the next level. Elemental powers lacking in range or accuracy? You could design tools for that. Super strength, speed or some other physical ability putting stress on your body? You have the solution. If there's something someone needs to shore up a power's strengths or weaknesses, you can probably think up and build something over the weekend. You'll just need the tools, resources and a healthy dose of imagination.


-Unusual Attire (Wonderland No More) (600CP)
        Wonderland certainly has some unique styles of clothes, with some humans preferring clothing made from paper actual paper, not recycled or mixed with something else! Yet they somehow make it work. You can now make clothes out of any material or substance you want, even if they would normally not work at all for clothing. These clothes will not harm the wearer even if their properties normally would. Even so, the materials retain their other properties, which may prove detrimental in their own way. For example, a glass ball gown would not be at risk of cutting the wearer (and wouldn't actually be that stiff when worn), but it would still be at risk for shattering if directly struck (and the shattered pieces, no longer counting as clothing, could hurt the subject). Or if you had shoes made out of molten lava, the user wouldn't be burned, but they'd set on fire anything else they touched (and that resulting fire could in turn burn the wearer). On the flipside, though, any positive attributes of the materials will also be retained.


-Yet Another Halloween Fic (Generic Buffy Fanfiction) (600CP)
        You can now create magical Halloween costumes which enables the wearer to take on the personality and powers of the costume. The total power of all active costumes cannot exceed the power of the one who made them, and they mute any powers the users would otherwise have. You can choose whether or not this overwrites the memories of the user or merely impacts their mannerisms.
        CAPSTONE BOOSTED: The costumes may now manifest into their own living forms. The clown make up and purple suit will actually form into The Joker or that pair of cat ears becomes a cat. The form will be true to your vision of the costume. The limit to this is the same as before, all active costumes together cannot exceed your total power. The living costumes and worn costumes are in separate pools though, so you can have one person equal to your power by wearing a costume, as well as one living costume equal to your total power. Regarding living costumes powers, this works per attribute; you may be a million times stronger than a base human, but if you've only got 10x the mental processing power of a base human, you cannot make more than 10 costumes with human level intelligence, or 5 costumes with double human intelligence.
* Is Capstone boosted by Ancient Empowerment (Generic Buffy Fanfiction), located under the Efficiency domain


-Tailoring | Life Fibers (Kill la Kill) (700CP)
Tailoring (300CP)
        You have the knowledge of how to safely work with life fibers, and how to make them into clothing that empowers (or inhibits) the wearer. In addition, because you know how Life Fiber uniforms work, you know their weak spots better than anyone.
Life Fibers (400CP)
        A medium-sized spool of Life Fiber. It's only enough to maybe make a pair of gloves out of, but with the proper knowledge, one could create Goku Uniforms- Or enhance existing articles of clothing to be like Goku Uniforms. One spool of thread is enough to make several one-star outfits, three two-star outfits, or a single three-star outfit, assuming you have the knowledge of how to work with Life Fibers.
-The Sewing Machine | No capes | I used to design for GODS | Sewing and Showcasing Room | And Machine Washable, dahling (The Incredibles) (1700CP)
The Sewing Machine (100CP)
        Now you might be wondering why I'm offering a single sewing machine... That's because this technological masterpiece is the very platonic ideal of a sewing machine. This is the one machine fit to work on designs worn by GODS. Working with this will enhance all your sewing skills to greater heights.
No capes (200CP)
        They snag on things, get caught in turbines, generally get in the way, and not many people can even pull the caped look off... Too much trouble to be worth it. And likewise, you can pick up on the weaknesses in designs extremely quickly, able to remove them or simply attempt to cover all your bases when you create something. Never again shall you create a suit that will fall short or hinder the wearer.
I used to design for GODS (400CP)
        And your skill is a testament to that lofty ideal. Designing things to be bold, dramatic, heroic, and just plain look good is as easy as breathing to you. Now the equal of Edna Mode herself, you'll most likely be asked to design for "super"models in Milan on a regular basis... but it's just not the same, Dahling. Your real skill lies with the Super fashion after all, and Super Suits is what you excel in. To the point that you could even make people look good in spandex.
Sewing and Showcasing Room (400CP)
        A large room perfect for any sewing or otherwise creating of Super Suits and other clothing. It comes with high tech sewing equipment, an enormous supply of different mannequins, and a gallery for when you want to show off your best designs. Movable seating and extremely durable glass panes included. May be attached to the Warehouse or any of your properties after the jump.
And Machine Washable, dahling (600CP)
        Of course looking good isn't all there is to a good Suit. It also needs to be very sturdy, comfortable, withstand extreme temperatures, be bulletproof, specialized to complement the wearer's powers, and yet breathe like egyptian cotton. Oh, and be machine washable, that's a new feature. So, it's a good thing that you're able to create specialized Super Suits like these for virtually any kind of powers. Suits that stretch with elastic Supers, that go invisible with an invisible Super, and much more. With time you could even find ways to incorporate armor and electronics into your skin-tight suits. It may not be able to do everything... but it can do a hell of a lot more than it should be able to. And of course you also get the ability to create general technology to help out with your work, like high-tech sewing machines, laser turrets built into ceilings, and bulky invisibility generators…

-Geomancy (World of Darkness - Mortal) (100CP)
        The art of geomancy (known as feng shui in the East) is the study of harmonizing the physical environment with the flow of energy. The goal of feng-shui is to create the ideal place to live or work. Through a combination of architectural design and mystic mathematics, a geomancer plans a pattern that must be duplicated within the entire structure (in the case of a building) or the layout of a room or series of connected rooms (in the case of interior design). Implementing this design increases the time required and the cost of the work involved, but practitioners consider it well worth the effort. When designing a geomancy effect, the thaumaturge chooses a single Attribute or Skill to be the focus.
        Once assigned, the Trait cannot be changed without completely redesigning the location. Attribute-based designs are more difficult to create than Skill-based ones. The selected Trait must reflect the building or space's function. For example, a library might enhance academic or research skills. If the thaumaturge is successful, she creates a unique design that benefits those who use the location in the manner for which it was created, provided that the design is followed perfectly. If the thaumaturge creates her geomancy design successfully, and the architect or interior designer successfully integrates the design into the physical location, the flow of energy is modified within the space. Any action that takes place in the space using the designated Attribute or Skill may gain a bonus.
        Once a geomantic design is created and implemented, it remains in effect indefinitely unless something happens to disrupt or change the flow of energy. Natural disasters may change the magical landscape more than they appear to affect it physically, requiring geomantic designs to be realigned. New construction or destruction of buildings or even spaces within a building may require that a thaumaturge reassess the location for potential updates. Poorly designed geomantic locations may disrupt those around them, as well. The only limits on the number of designs a geomancer may create are her time, her capability and the ability of others to come up with the resources to put her designs into place.


-Inner Linings (Final Fantasy XIV) (100CP)
        A customer came to you one day with a strange request for you to make a leather jacket which would be thinner, enough so that it would take multiple jackets to equal the bulk and weight of a normal jacket. As strange as that request was, when you watched him enchant the various jackets it suddenly made sense. Instead of trying to enchant a single jacket multiple times, he would wear multiple jackets enchanted once. But you can improve on that idea. Instead of attempting to craft multiple thinner jackets, you've opened up inner linings in existing pieces of work. As you predicted, while the ease of stacking enchantments has gone up, the overall durability of the item has dropped by a bit. Perhaps with time and better materials, you could rectify the second point. Having so many inner linings also helps quite a bit when it comes to deeper pockets, which is a nice side effect.


-Prodigy Enchanter (God Catching Alchemy Meister) (100CP)
        Alchemists are the most known for giving magical properties to weapons and potions, and yet, any skilled enough mage can do the same thing, perhaps even better when it's an element they control well enough. That's the case with you, prepared in case you needed to enchant something and didn't have the time or resources to get a good alchemist. While the design and other details may not be as good as the work of a professional, you are capable of imbuing the power of magic in any item you wish to use. Effectiveness depending on your mana and affinity.


-You Runed Everything (Elder Scrolls Online) (100CP)
        Before the development of the Arcane Enchanter in the 4th Era which streamlined enchanting to the point that any novice without even the barest hint of magicka could bind an enchantment, and even before the Guild-standardized enchanting techniques of the 3rd Era which drastically eased the process to a simple matter of shoving stored magicka into an item, the tool of choice for infusing an item with a magical effect was the humble Glyph. A Glyph is a combination of three runes, one inscribed with the potency which determines the base strength and whether it adds or removes, one with the desired attribute to effect such as health or a specific element , and a third designating its aspect, ranging from Common to Legendary. You know enough to be able to use and translate up to Rank Five runes (Pora, Denara, Hade and Idode), with even more becoming available to you as you research and translate more.


-Gemcrafted (Touhou Luna Nights) (200CP)
You have the ability to turn use the power of gemstones to create an alternate dimension full of replicas of terrain and people. Additionally, you know how to create loyal, obedient monsters and replicas of other people who can fight for you, or perhaps just guard your alternate locations, and you may communicate with them clearly regardless of distance. A weak monster might require a couple of amethysts, while one that can fly around, fire lasers and take a terrible amount of damage might require at least a high-quality diamond. Creating alternate dimensions will require on the order of thousands of gemstones even for a relatively small patch of land. Also note that none of them are truly intelligent and just follow pre-programmed orders.


-Heretical Adaptation (Senki Zesshou Symphogear) (200CP)
        Symphogears are, in essence, a Relic adapted into a combat system for it's ability to generate massive amounts of energy that can be formatted into a certain kind of matter through a generic mass-energy converter. However, they also have the ability to 'evolve' overtime, gaining additional armor and improvements to features such as onboard thrusters. With a bit of study, it might be possible to apply this adaptive behavior to other materials, encouraging them to improve themselves over time.


-Loremaster (Divinity - Original Sin) (200CP)
        Dusty tomes and yellowing scrolls are remnants of history, fragments of knowledge from ages past sent forward through ink and paper. While much of the world fails to give these storehouses of information their proper credit, those who dive into them discover lost secrets to hold true power. Or at the very least, a few answers. Loremasters nearly always have some form of magical talent, as it is the study of the arcane in essence. However, there are those for whom it is the extent of their abilities to draw out a few secrets from the books and little else.
        Apprentices of the old lore are taught, not by rote, but by arguments. They are told to seek out the flaws in others' logic, to pick apart the minutia of another's words, and to seek the shades of truth in every conversation. While at first no student sees the value in this, they soon learn that they can apply such introspection to the magical items they find. With a few moments study and a jeweler's loupe they can discern the enchantment bound to a particular item.
        Unlike the other skills, this one requires further training to see its true worth. In the beginning, a novice Loremaster will only be able to discover the basics of an enchantment. The essential element or driving force. But as one grows more experienced they will be able to pick up the minutia, dipping into the ins and outs of even the most subtle enhancements.


-Magic Style: Enchantment (Fairy Tail) (200CP)
        It's time to choose the Magical Styles that you have already learned upon entering this world. Whilst most magical styles can be learned with time and effort and the right teacher or source of knowledge, buying them here will allow them to benefit from the skill that Magic Skill ranks grant as well as allow access to extremely rare or lost magics or magics that require certain traits to use. A list of the magics that can be bought as well as their costs can be found at the end of the jump document. It should be noted that some Magic Styles will not be purchasable through this option. Most of these are Holder Type magics, which all deal with magical items that are offered for purchase in the item section, and some are simply Caster Type magics that are too unique and either offered as part of a separate perk or not at all. This may change in the future as the series progresses or not.


-Magic: Enchanting (Samurai Jack) (200CP)
        You can grant magical properties to weapons by marking them with ancient runes. Right now you only know how to give weapons elemental properties, but you can learn more enchantments by studying other enchanted and magical weapons.


-Magical Specializations (Kane Chronicles) (200CP)
        The true worth of every magician is their path specialization. You have come to possess knowledge, you have a few years of training in a path specialization of your choice, enough to make you an expert though you are still many years from being a master. A list of canon specializations will be at the notes section at the bottom of the jump. This perk can be taken multiple times.
        Charm Magic: The magic concerned with the enchantment of permanent magical devices and objects, such as a magician's tools and the ritual implements required for complex and powerful spells( many such implements are single use and highly specific) as well as pre-prepared spellcasting.


-Minor Enchantment (Gunnerkrigg Court) (200CP)
        Make boots that will always fit or makeups that change to your whims. These magical tricks have a very wide range of applications but will generally not be on a very grand scale; though the utility from walking on walls is not to be denied.


-Specialist's Hammer (Dark Souls 2) (200CP)
        Bridging the mystical and with the mundane, mystical with the tools of man, are there many acts more satisfying than that? With a solid hammer and good ember, you are capable of just such feats. You may harness the qualities of magical, supernatural or just outright strange materials to improve existing constructs not composed of such things. An iron sword could be imbued with the arcane nature of the soul to better bypass armor, or a shield with the power to halt darkness infused attacks. You are also bestowed skill with smithing, though mostly towards the area that the above powers require. That is to say, hammering and burning the powers of material described above into things.


-Weapon Absorption (Dark Cloud) (200CP)
        Were the Moon People the ones who developed weapons as they exist in the world today? Perhaps, with their technological expertise, they tampered with such things - but we may well never know. Your weapons modified with this will adapt the concept of "experience", allowing them to grow as more enemies are defeated with them. As more enemies are defeated, you can absorb other weapons into the base template - improving the qualities of the original weapon.


-Blessed By A God: Enchanting (Everyone Else is a Returnee) (300CP)
        Gain a blessing from one of the recorded gods, gaining a boost in whatever skill or stat they stand for. Additionally, you exemplify that skill or trait, standing heads and shoulders above all others in that field. These gods and goddesses cover just about every domain and aspect there is, from fire to beauty to magic.


-Paint to Life (Ib) (300CP)
It's said that spirits dwell in objects into which people put their feelings, and the same applies for artwork.  You now have the ability to give life to paintings, statues, and other artworks.  Even a crayon sketch of a sun would give off heat and light as if it were real.  There are but a couple of catches.  First, you can only animate works that you made by your own hands.  Second, they cannot be of people who exist in the real world; in the case of inanimate things such as moons and stars, or things that have multiple copies such as a species of snake, they can still be created.  Third, to give life to an artwork you must sacrifice a small but vital piece of your own life.  It is possible to recover in time, but overdoing things may put you at the edge of death.  Although you can create works that have magical powers, to fully use their magic in the real world they would require continual magic support from you.  Also, the act of creation does not give you control over the animated works, and they retain independent wills, though they will generally respect their maker.


-Profession: Enchanting (World of Warcraft) (300CP)
        Imbue all manner of equitable items with magical properties and enhancements using dusts, essences and shards gained by disenchanting (breaking down) magical items that are no longer useful. Enchanters can also make a few low-level wands, as well as oils that can be applied to weapons providing a temporary magical buff. You also have the ability to create Inscriptions which act as enchantments for your skills & abilities. Zen Master: At this level you've mastered everything from basics to advanced. Additionally you've expanded your knowledge of the profession beyond the mastery of both basics and advanced stuff to complete understanding of it. At this level you're on even playing field with top 1% of your profession. Should you write down your knowledge it would easily be considered a work of art in that field.


-The Great Enchanter (Bartimaeus Sequence) (300CP)
        Staff of Gladstone, Amulet of Samarkand, Ring of Solomon, this world sure has a lot of artifacts, heh? Well, now you can make even more! You become unbelievably talented at binding Djinn into items to give them mystical powers. Summon a djinni and stitch it into a rug to make a flying carpet? Easypeasy. Detonation Sticks, Convulsion spheres and flux bombs, all a day's work. You still need the parts, but they seem almost eager to flow into the right shape under your expert hands.


-A Price for Everything (Rick And Morty) (400CP)
        Curses! You can curse objects. The curse affects anyone in possession of the object and can only be dispelled by unnaturally advanced science or magic. The more ironic the object/curse combination the more powerful it is. Pairs of running shoes that cause people to run till they die, fox boas that skin the user, etc.


-Artisan (Silmarillion) (400CP)
        You are considered a skilled craftsman even among the Dwarves. Weapons and armor that can stand the test of time and come out looking newly crafted centuries later. Mithril and other mystical metals are no harder than working with Iron and Steel for you. With much time and energy you may also enchant the items as you craft them, like the Dragon-helm which struck an unnatural fear into the enemies of its wearer. While you are skilled in the crafting of many things it is your mastery of the construction of weapons and armor that is truly awe inspiring. Perhaps with practice and time you might even be considered the equal of Telchar.


-Celestial Mirror (Final Fantasy X) (400CP)
Long ago, it was believed that seven luminaries possessed weapons which were peerless in their respective categories. Though the legends themselves have been lost to time, the weapons still exist – as does a method to obtain them. But power never comes without a sacrifice or two…
You possess the ability to enhance your weapon to a remarkable degree, by allowing them to absorb experience and grow naturally. However, to facilitate this growth, not only will the strength of your weapon decrease while it is growing, the power of its effects will also decrease. Naturally as you may have suspected, the only way for a weapon to gain experience is to emerge victorious from a fight...you have a long road ahead of you Guardian. It’s probably best to start with some easy fiends.
You can return your weapon to full strength at any time, but its growth will stop while in this state.


-Craftsman (Hercules) (400CP)
        Greek myth sure does love it's weapons and armors, doesn't it? You're great at making both, now. Not only do you have a preternatural skill at putting together weapons, armor and other artefacts of the very highest quality, being able to work legendary items from common tools and materials, but you're also a whiz at enchanting them. Simply put, you can imbue just about any and all magic and power you have into items, and have it work as you desire. It also helps you figure out existing examples of craft, and replicating the effects on your own.


-Enchantment (Silmarillion) (400CP)
        The Elves are capable of great works of Enchantment, able to infuse their spirits into things they create and tie into the natural forces of Arda. Rings of power, magical orbs that can see far distance, runes of power crafted alongside the Dwarves. You are an expert on the path of enchantment. Non-weapon enchanted items are your expertise and with enough time and training you could potentially create a ring of power to rival even that of Sauron or craft something in the like of the mighty Silmarils.


-Enchantment? (Dragon Age) (400CP)
        That's odd, you seem to understand the process of inscribing lyrium runes on items, to add or enhance properties. Without lyrium, enchantments are temporary.


-Iterative Improvement (Worm) (400CP)
        Each day you gain a certain amount of charge, which you can spend to effectively enchant objects with superpowers. The more charge you invest in a particular object, the more you can improve and expand its abilities. A single day's charge would give an object a minor power, but over time you can increase it with no upper limit beyond your investment. These objects only work for you unless you make it otherwise. As you use your power, experiment with it, and it matures from conflict and experience, the amount of charge you gain per day will increase. You can hold about a month's worth of charge at any one time, any more will be wasted.
        * Do note that at the end of the jump the power turns innate and is not supplied by a shard anymore


-Runeforging (Azeroth) (400CP)
        Runeforging is the art of imbuing your weapons with runes that grant said weapon additional abilities or strengthening your own abilities. Though the game only lists 4 abilities with this you can fanwank responsibly to add additional runeforge abilities of your own. Purchasing this perk also allows you to imbue a weapon with both an Enchant as well as a Runeforging.


-Enchantment (World of Darkness - Sorcerer) (500CP)
        The sorcery of creating items with magical abilities and properties. Five ranks, top rank cost 500CP. Examples of each rank below.
        [1] The Enchanter creates a minor item with limited use only and a tight area of influence. Such as a jacket that works as abnormally good camouflage in a crowd, or glasses that never fog.
        [2] The Enchanter creates a more powerful talisman that is noticeable as magic. A flask that blocks three bullets and no more, objects that increase a mundane skill by a noticeable amount when used.
        [3] The Enchanter creates a talisman whose function is obviously magical. Shoes that double running speed, a charm that can protect its wearer from magic three times a day.
        [4] The Enchanter creates a talisman that is able to defy several of the limitations of the Consensus. Clothing that grant superhumanly impressive but otherwise mundane abilities, a throwing knife that never shall never miss.
        [5] The Enchanter creates talisman with almost miraculous powers. A golem, or a ring that hides its user from magical detection.


-Call Me Parry (Eureka-Warehouse 13-Alphas) (600CP)
        You have a unique insight into how to combine Artefacts in order to enhance and alter the nature of their effects, often by an entire order of magnitude, and even create new Artefacts through careful research and experimentation.


-Crystal Crafter (Anima Beyond Fantasy) (600CP)
        The world is not one made for your kind. Artifacts are forged for wizards and warriors, and few for you. That will not stop you, however. By taking a gemstone, you can imbue it with potential, cutting and polishing and changing it until it amplifies the psychic abilities of the one who bears it, making the powers of the mind easier to call upon and stronger when used.


-Fuinjutsu Prodigy (Naruto) (600CP)
        You are one of the very few who are talented in the art of Fuinjutsu, an esoteric discipline combining all the complexities of calligraphy and physics. Despite the difficulty in learning fuinjutsu, skilled practitioners find it well worth it. Fuinjutsu, or sealing, is at its most basic storing something within something else through symbols to be released at another time. More advanced techniques still follow this same principle, but to great effect. Seal masters can seal away the elements, chakra, form summoning contracts, teleport, or even summon and bind souls using these principles. It's only downside is that this art is massively difficult to learn even for the talented, and will take years of intense study to master. You start off knowing how to make the two most basic of seals: The storage seal which allows you to store items in slips of paper much smaller than they are, and the explosive seal which is basically a few glyphs on a piece of paper the size of a greeting card that explodes like a small amount of plastique.


-Hell Jumper Creator (Dragon Ball) (600CP)
        Why let just one thing take pride of place as your favourite creation? If you make two, you can make them into an even better single creation! It just needs a bit of work here and there. With your personal creations, you're able to combine any two similar creations into a greater whole. While this combination can only be done once, it will be more and more effective the more similar the two parts that are being combined are. Two swords that you've made, without being the same type of sword or same material of make, would only be half again as good once combined. Two swords that are exactly the same, down to the method of creation and time spent on the smithing? You'd have a sword hundreds of times more powerful than either of the originals. So long as you personally made it or had a large hand in its creation, you'll be able to apply this fusion and even reverse the fusion to separate the two halves once more.


-Infusionist (Monster Hunter) (600CP)
        The ability to infuse items with abilities, Usually Elemental abilities. How good the infused ability depends on the quality and use of the item.


-Lord Jumper's Armor (Skulduggery Pleasant v1.05) (600CP)
        You can infuse copies of your abilities into objects, turning them into focuses for those powers. Using these focuses in concert with the original power within your body will see your might with these abilities enhanced dramatically. Alternatively, you could loan these items to allies and subordinates to grant them access to these powers. Objects that you infuse with your power are also infused with your will. This allows them to act independently to enact your will, and enables them to refuse others the right to use the power they grant. You may only create one focus per power, and a given item can only contain one power at a time. When these items are destroyed, the power flows back into you, and you can create a new focus for it.
        Boosted: Your power has risen to new heights in a number of different ways. Firstly, you are capable of creating multiple focuses for the same ability with no loss in their overall power level, and using the same item as a focus for more than a single ability. The true strength of this ability, however, is that each and every one of your powers has become semi-sentient being of its own, a kind of pseudo-consciousness based on your will attached to the ability. These consciousnesses are aligned with you in terms of morality and intent, and can add their force of will to yours. When you work in concert with them, your precision, control, and raw power output increase without any additional exertion on your part. Furthermore, in the event that you are incapacitated in some fashion, these consciousnesses can take control of your body, wielding the power they are attached to in order to protect your body until you return. Alternatively, you could grant your powers control of your body while you fully devote your mind to other tasks. Because of this boost, you may choose to make your focuses tangible avatars of your individual powers, turning them from semi-sentient objects to fully sapient ones. These conscious powers will not manifest as whispering voices in the back of your head unless you want them to.


-Master enchanter (Unmodded Minecraft) (600CP)
        Removing the randomness and ambiguity of the usual process is the least of what you can do. You don't suffer any restrictions when it comes to what kind of item can get what kind of enchantment, so you can fish up treasures with a chain-sickle or empower a shovel to deal massive damage to the undead. Selectively remove or add new effects to an existing magical item, or transfer effects from one item to another. Fuse multiple similar magical items together to make a single, stronger item. While there are limits to how much magic that can be crammed into something, the limit is much higher for you. This skill also covers the creation of space-bending chests that can store far more than their external dimensions should allow for.


-New Age Necromancer (Dungeon Keeper Ami) (600CP)
        Once upon a time wizards were happy enough being able to raise undead, throw fireballs, and curse their enemies, well those were the old days and this is now. You are a modern wizard, you know the value of a well enchanted suit of armor. You know how to mix enchantments in such a way that things such as moving remote piloted armor suits are a very real possibility that you can make reality, magic powered railroads and three dimensional rune set ups are simply child's play for you, and even something as complicated as creating a gold powered dungeon heart is eventually possible. Though most enchantments are powered by mana you can offset this somewhat in two ways, either by instead binding the souls of the dead to your creations lowering the mana cost considerably the more souls you bind to it or by burning gold to take the place of mana that would be spent if you are squeamish.


-NineRealms Craftsman (The Avengers - Earth's Mightiest Heroes) (600CP)
        You have the skill to create wonders; not only those of technology, but of magic as well. You're a skilled enchanter, capable of creating armor and weaponry that withstands the ages and never dulls or breaks; your skill is such that you can permanently enchant Uru safely, which would allow you to create weapons like Mjolnir or Stormbreaker. You're even capable of enchanting machinery; granting them similar magical effects, and more. Even without magic, your crafts are of quality worthy of the gods, and the quality of all of your future creations will be increased greatly. Post-Spark, your ability to create wonders will increase; weaponry that would allow one to go toe to toe with cosmic beings and bridges that span the worlds you've visited; with time, there's very little you couldn't create.


-The Fire in the Forging (Circle of Magic) (600CP)
        You have acquired a mastery of enchantment, the imprinting of permanent or semipermanent magical effects into your chosen medium. Weapons imbued with fire, cloth as protective as armor, far more powerful potions, cupcakes that satisfy all food cravings for days, trees that eat sound, stone paths that rearrange themselves every day... if you can figure out an effect, there's a good chance you can, eventually, figure out how to impart it... assuming you have the right magics and enough power at your disposal.


-The Rune Is Mightier Than The Sword | Runic Spell Innovator | Enchanting  (World Seed) (700CP)
        The Rune Is Mightier Than The Sword (100CP)
        The one thing throwing people off the runic language is its sheer volume. Considering that there are ninety-nine million, two hundred and thirty thousand, seven hundred and sixty nine of them, representing every single word and concept in all known languages, even things such as watering the grass every week, that's no surprise. Because of that, even learning the runic language can be a challenge, requiring either a brain implant or some other form of perfect memory. Anyone who doesn't have access to these things needs to spend time and effort to search for those runes they'll actually use and transcribe them into a book or save them to their computer. Luckily, you won't have to deal with such shortcuts: as of now, you are fluent in the entirety of the runic language, and will never forget it. Furthermore, as you will undoubtedly encounter words and concepts foreign to the people in this universe throughout your travels, it will update itself to include runes for anything you might encounter in the future.
Runic Spell Innovator (200CP)
        Considering that one simply needs to combine the runes for Blast and Fire to make a fireball, or use the do the same with the Reinforce and Mind runes to create a basic spell to protect against mind altering effects, one might think that runic magic is incredibly easy. Well, one would be wrong. Runes can be considered a programming language of sorts, affecting reality. They are used to program magical devices, and also for Runic Magic, an alternative to Arcane Magic that uses less mana and requires less control over your mana, but only does exactly what you program it to do. Now, as with regular programming, any schmuck can do the equivalent of writing hello world and throw a fireball or two, but anything more complex than that requires intelligence, creativity, ingenuity, and patience. Things that you now possess in spades. And with that and the knowledge of the runic language, infinite possibilities lie open to you: whether it's bashing someone's head in with the Force rune, setting up intricate spell diagrams and runic circles to automate even the most complex of processes, or creating spells of all magical disciplines for anything you can think of and more, someone who truly knows how to use Runic Magic is a sight to behold. And your true talent, the invention and creation of new runic spells and programs, applies to all of these avenues. If you keep at it, no magic will be beyond your reach.
Enchanting (400CP)
        Enchanting is a skill probably best described as the enhancement of an object's Aura. At first, one would need to find out which enhancement fits an object best, though skilled enchanters obviously do not need to care about that, and then lay down a basic enchantment that increases a stat, like wisdom and strength, or attack and defence. Like normal magic, there are two forms of enchanting, arcane and runic, though enchanting is by no means a magic, but rather a skill like sewing or tailoring. The former requires you to know the right school of magic related to your enchantments, like a magic that increases toughness for a durability enchantment, but is more powerful because of that, while the latter simply requires you to know the right runes and how to use them.
        Although normally people would specialize in one of these forms of enchanting, you're skilled in both of them, enough that you'll soon be able to easily start using more advanced form of enchanting, such as giving objects elemental enchantments or even very specific abilities, though for the latter you need to be at least somewhat familiar with them yourself.
        With some experimentation, you'll also be able to learn techniques that will increase the power of your enchantments by dozens of times, like material enchanting, where you enchant an object at every stage of its creation, such as enchanting the steel a sword will be forged from, the fire that will be used to melt it, and the water used to cool it, after which you enchant the finished sword one last time after its completion.
        Another trick to enchanting is that natural objects like wood or animal parts can fit up to two or three times more enchantments like man made ones in them. After a creature dies, and its soul dissipates, the aura is left withered, a shadow of its former self. But because of that hollowness, that emptiness, those items have far more room for improvement of their aura, allowing for the creation of a staff that can match up to any plasma weapon, or a bow that will never miss its mark.
        You excel at finding similar loopholes and techniques to advance your skills whether they are enchanting or not, and even if you were ever stuck, with seemingly no way to advance your skills to the next level, as long as you continue to research and experiment, you'll also be able to either innovate or learn something that will allow them to continue on growing. This works even when it absolutely shouldn't. Rest assured, there will be no barriers to bar you from growing ever more competent. Work at it for a few years, and even something on the level of the Seeds would not be beyond you. And considering your skill at enchanting, that will become useful far sooner than you might've thought, starting at a level others would need years to reach.
        You can probe the Aura of anything with a mere glance, knowing at a moment's notice what enchantments would fit best, and the speed at which you work your magic might make other people think you're doing it with just a wave of your hand. And you'll continue to be able to work at that speed no matter how complex the work you're attempting. Who knows, you might even become the first combat enchanter with that kind of skill.


-Lordship of All Things | Cultivation | Required Secondary Abilities (Desolate Era Part I - The Three Realms) (800CP)
        Lordship of All Things (800CP)
        Formations can, through being shaped in particular directions, powered by multiple people or formation flags, result in a variety of different effects. Such effects include creating an attacking formation which would allow a small number of weaker cultivators to take out one stronger than them, or a trapping formation that only brute strength completely eclipsing that of the people controlling it could hope to break, and finally, one can even use formations to help gather elemental energy and ki so they can train much faster than what would normally be possible. All of this knowledge and more is now passed on to you, as you find yourself a master of Formations, their creation, and their utilization, as well as heavy insight into the Grand Dao of Formations. With a year of practice and the proper reagents, you could even conceivably create formations of the scope which caused the four thousand kilometer wide elemental stone mine in the Ji Clan's territory through the gathering of elemental energy, and with a decade, setting down formations like ones that would normally be set around the Ji Clan territory, capable of killing Celestial Immortals, could be qualified as a warm up (depending on your own level of power of course) Creating a formation such as the Rahu Formation that allows a multitude of cultivators to band together in order to form an avatar that is vastly stronger than the sum of its parts would take you a decade or so of research (once again, that is if you had the required level of power for it). Keep in mind, however, that creating formations also requires insight into the Daos. Creating a Wind Formation will be absolutely impossible without the necessary insight into the Dao of Wind.
        To add to this, you also gain tremendous insight into the Grand Dao of Constructs, allowing you to, with enough practice, create golems equal to the Daofather Golems that the Lord of All Things created, and make them in bulk just as he did. You do need the right materials and many assistants for that, however. Finally, you gain the ability to create and cultivate strange creatures known as Queens who are able to give birth to hundreds of warriors to create an army. Both the appearance of the Queens and warriors are completely up to you, and they'll be at the same level of intelligence as a normal sentient being. At first, you'll simply be able to make one or two of them at the Xiantian Level, with their children only being at the Houtian Realm, and only in their dozens. But as your own personal power increases, you could create or upgrade queens capable of rivaling even Empyrean Gods and cultivators stronger stall, with them being capable of birthing thousands of lesser creatures. The intelligence of their spawn is also variable, with some of the weaker grunts simply being like insects that the Queens can see through and puppet from a distance, and their generals being at the very top of the level they were spawned at and being just as intelligent as the Queens. This scales with your cultivation level as the Golems or Queens are always one level below you. In future Jumps you'll find yourself picking up arts and abilities similar to constructs and formations incredibly quickly.
        Cultivation (0CP)
        In this world, people use the art of cultivation to increase their powers. This practice is mostly divided into two ranks: Ki refiners, who generally rely on magical techniques and treasures to fight, powered by the Elemental Essences they absorb, and Fiendgod Body Refiners, who strive to turn their bodies into those of the ancient Fiendgods and utilize divine abilities with vastly varying effects, such as increasing their size, adding extra arms, or even strengthening their bodies beyond their already impressive levels, making their physical abilities and general battle prowess much higher than those of a Ki refiner in exchange for lacking the ability to use treasures and weapons. Thus you get a technique from each of these two types of cultivation to study. Be warned though, that although Fiendgod Body Refiners are much more powerful, their ways of cultivation may be painful to the extreme, or extremely hard to advance in, resulting in decades of effort for just a bit of progress.
        There are many stages to cultivation, starting with the Houtian Stage, which signals the very start of a journey, as well as the increase of a cultivator's lifespan to over a hundred years. Then comes the Xiantian Stage, where the body is completely reforged for perfection, and the cultivator's lifespan increases to over two hundred years. The third stage is called Zifu, in which the practitioner forms their own Violet Palace which contains their liquified Ki energy, and enables them to live over four hundred years. The fourth stage, called Wanxiang, is the stage of manifestation, where the practitioner gains access to Divine Will, and increases their lifespan to eight hundred years. The fifth stage, called Primal, gives the practitioner the ability to live forever* (not actually forever)*, with no limits on their lifespan After that comes the Void or Earth mmortal Stage. When a practitioner reaches the Void Stage and attempts to progress to the next level. they shall be met with a final Tribulation. This is a test sent down by the heavens in the form of heavenly wind, fire, and lightning strikes that they must either bear or face total soul annihilation. Then they must pass a test of their Dao Heart in the form of the Demonheart Tribulation, where they shall be tested to see if they are truly dedicated in the matters of Cultivation, and whether they are willing to abandon everything for its sake, though it can be resisted with a powerful Heartforce. If they succeed in this Tribulation, they shall reach the Celestial Immortal Stage, or, in the case of Body Refiners, the Empyrean God Stage, where they shall break free of the mortal coil and the five elements. After that, there are two more stages for both paths of Cultivation: True Immortal for Ki Refiners, or True God for Body Refiners, and then Daofather for Ki Refiners, and Elder God for Body Refiners. Finally, there is the very pinnacle of power in the Three Realms, the World level. This is the level of cultivation Pangu was at when he created the Pangu Chaosworld, and Nuwa similarly reached. While there are even higher levels of power to be grasped, they need not be mentioned for now, and you won't be able to reach them during this jump.
        On a final note, once every three hundred years after a practitioner steps into the Zifu Realm, they will be met with a minor tribulation, which will build up in power until finally, they shall face one major tribulation every nine hundred years. Three centuries a Tribulation, nine a Calamity, this shall continue until they either reach the Celestial Immortal stage, or have their souls shattered. For the purposes of this perk you'll be given a technique in both Body Refining and Ki Refining that will last you until the Wanxiang Stage, at which point you'll have to fend for yourself. For 50 CP you can get one that will allow you to advance to the Celestial Immortal and Empyrean God level, using both types of cultivation. Regardless of whether you buy the technique that allows you to train to the Celestial Immortal/Empyrean God level or not, the technique you get is of the highest quality, and you won't need to worry about your future growth being crippled by using it. Your cultivation technique may be aligned towards whatever Dao you wish it to be.
        Required Secondary Abilities (0CP)
        The laws of this Universe are very different from those you are used to, and things such as moving faster than sound are possible for even the most base rank and file Yet they find themselves lacking things such as sonic booms. In this Universe and the ones you will travel to in the future, such protections will thus continue to exist. In addition to this, spending countless years on a single task, or just on living a normal life, also don't seem to be a problem for you anymore.
        * Just as a note any creatures created in the world by someone like those queens are absolutely loyalty




 --- Domain: Skills: Magitech (24) (36 Perks) --- 




-Build That Wall (Bastion) (100CP)
        You know the basics of Caelondian technology. You understand how to harness the semimystical power of Cores and turn it into usable Mantic energy, to power basic machinery, shortrange flying machines, computers, and a variety of other uses. More interestingly, you can use Core power to reinforce existing structures, running a Matic current through it to enhance whatever physical properties it possesses, usually durability, though other uses are possible. This is what allowed structures like the Rippling Wall and the Bastion to survive the Calamity as well as they did. You also gain basic skill for mundane construction.


-Sorcery Capsules (I Saved Too Many Girls And Caused The Apocalypse) (100CP)
        The impossible marriage between science and magic allowed the creation of these small capsules, which purpose is to store intricate spells for their later use. Think of magical grenades with multiple types. You gain a whole dozen of these small artifacts, as well as the instructions of how to make more and fill them with all kinds of spells.


-Tech Wizard (Devil Survivor) (100CP)
        You're really good with machines. You just sort of understand how they work, better than most. But not just regular machinery, no. You've learned how magitech works too, to a certain extent. COMPs are incredibly powerful tools, allowing users to summon demons, learn magic, go beyond normal human limits, and fight on the same level as demons. You can't build one yet, but you've figured out how they work, and even how to modify the coding to a certain extent. Won't the Shomonkai be surprised to find out they're no longer safe from their own toys?


-Antimatter Manipulation Principle (Final Fantasy XIII) (200CP)
        You understand the science at work behind Cocoon's technology. You may not have the equipment to reproduce it, but you can manipulate gravity to a limited degree even without it - enough to save you from falls.
        With suitable tools however, you could make all sorts of equipment and mechanical wonders, even up to graviton cores that can maintain giant aerial defence platforms.


-Antimatter Temporal Principle (Final Fantasy XIII 3) (200CP)
        The same antimatter manipulation principle developed by the scientists of ancient Academia was banned by the Fal'Cie Pandaemonium in the recent years, and all its researchers vanished. After careful research, you've come to realize why. Through extensive manipulation, Chaos itself can be controlled with AMP, and while the degree of control you can exert on it is limited even you can stop time for five seconds at will. However, you also move at a reduced pace, as the sheer effort of manifesting this unnatural phenomenon drains you in more ways than simply energy.
        After trying this twice in rapid succession, you found yourself completely drained, but if you alone could perform such a feat even with significant support from any piece of ancient AMP technology then perhaps the Fal'Cie banned it out of fear that it would evolve to something greater
        Without this research available, and with most of the team lost, you wonder if it would have been impossible otherwise to reconstruct this technology. After all, only the significant presence of Chaos provoked the research to begin with, long after Gran Pulse had fallen.


-Light-Tech (Nexus 2.0) (200CP)
        The primary advantage common goblins make use of is technology, crossing several fields of study from alchemy to metalworking and engineering to medical sciences. However, their greatest technologies are their Light-Tech, technology that interfaces directly with their Light and other supernatural powers, such as Mist once they unlock it. By default, this allows them to focus their Light through any tech they make to enhance its function, but with practice, they can extend this to other sources of power they may possess. This can also be used on objects they didn't craft, but is instead familiar with, however it will have some loss in effectiveness the less familiar with the object they are.


-Magitech Augmentation Theories, 14th (Final Fantasy XIV) (200CP)
        The Garlean use of Magitek doesn't just end with automatons. Many of the weapons, armor, and even day today objects have benefited from the implementation of magitek. Inside this textbook is a collection of theories and applications that have been tested and improved. You could most likely learn from these theories and apply the principles of magitek to any inanimate object .We've seen from live samples that Magitek doesn't just enhance the magical properties of an item it seems to add in neat little quirks like transformation sequences and magic resistant coatings as well. It's likely you could scale this up to high levels with a substantial amount of further analysis.


-Ride the Winds of Inspiration (World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression) (200CP)
        Mania, a strange phenomenon. It is not generated by geniuses alone. Instead, all kinds of mortal thought can generate low amounts of Mania, with scientific or mathematical thought generating more, and the sort of thought one might call "revolutionary" (politically, scientifically, ethically, it doesn't seem matter) generating the most. In this world there is a phenomena known as 'Maniac Storms' and thanks to your outsider's perspective you've hit upon an idea. If there are 'storms' of Mania then there must be 'winds and currents' by applying this theory to your wonders you can create wonders that need no Mania to feed on, though they still will cause Havoc in the hands of a mere mortal. This technique does rely upon the winds of mania as a whole though so be careful, it could fail in lands where the local 'winds' aren't strong enough such as a rural backwater town or an amish village. In lands without proper technology you need to look for innovation, for it really is the thought that counts.


-Technomage (Libriomancer) (200CP)
        While not a magic user per se you have the unique ability to make magic and technology play along together in just the right kind of way. Perhaps you can take a fictional operating system out of a book and install it on a real computer. Or create a self replicating swarm of nanomachines from a sliver of magically created tissue. Whatever it is, you can do it and are likely to be the envy of your magical peers.


-Technomage (Strike Witches) (200CP)
        Strike Witches generally rely on service crews to tune and repair their striker, but not you. You'll be able to do the job much better and be able to modify your Striker to aid you focus your speed, defense or attack if you have offensive magical abilities. If you have technology from other jumps, you'll be able to incorporate them into your striker and with enough time make one from scratch.


-Weird Science (Bleach) (200CP)
        While the rest of the Soul Society resembles feudal Japan, the Shinigami R&D area is the exception. Like them you can create devices that run off of spiritual power, and can, in time create mod souls as well.


-Playing with Dolls (Fate/Legends Land of the Rising Sun) (300CP)
        Ever have the ninja pushed for more tricks and tools to keep them ahead of their foes. It's only logical that their desires for a greater advantage over the raw power of the samurai would lead to such advancements in technology. The Danzou puppet is the culmination of incredible science and magic coming together as one, creating an artificial lifeform filled with the experiences and skills of many great ninja, equipped with advanced technology and powerful magic. It's also something you have the knowledge to make and more besides.
        You have the training in various disciplines to create advanced puppet bodies like this, as well as the weaponry and technology that Danzou makes use of in that body, even things like missiles. This covers both ordinary scientific knowledge and occult magecraft focused towards artificial bodies like this. It's quite possible to turn an existing person into one of these puppets, albeit more difficult than making it from scratch.
        One of the more impressive parts of this field is the techniques that allow for the recording and uploading of knowledge or skills that people possess. With a willing or incapacitated subject, you know how to examine what they know and copy it over to another person. Your studies in this field have also helped you realize how to capably combine magic with technology, creating things where the two work together to support and enhance both sides' effects instead of interfering. While you can't alter the basic metaphysics behind things such as mystery, you do know how to work it to your advantage.


-A World Is A Living Thing (Warhammer 40K - Craftworld Eldar Jumpchain) (400CP)
        Among the Exodites, the Infinity Circuit is known as the World Spirit, and upon the death of an Exodite, this network absorbs their soul, thus keeping them from the clutches of Slaanesh and allowing those still living to commune with them. Now you too bear the knowledge by which one might forge this great and intricate grid of stone circles, obelisks, and menhirs. It will take some time, of course, to cover an entire world - likely more time you will have in a given journey at any rate - but it is entirely possible to produce a smaller version over say, the course of three years, protecting the souls of those within an area about the size of a small township. May the dead know peace at last.


-Bonesinger (Warhammer 40K - Craftworld Eldar Jumpchain) (400CP)
        Dear child, the Eldar do not simply build their wondrous technology. Instead, they rely on the power of song to shape their creations into being. This is a very demanding process, which requires a unique mix of artistic and scientific knowledge. Most importantly of all, a strong mind is necessary for this process. Bonesingers sing a psychic song, and its melodies form a psychoactive material from the warp itself, called Wraithbone. This lightweight material is stronger than titanium but is far more flexible and weighs less. Additionally you can psychically grow crystals that are the basis of their laser & lance technology. You have the knowledge and ability to sing any Eldar technology and any technology you know into being and more than that, eons of experience in doing so. Even so, the more complex an item is, the more time it takes to create said item. A whole choir of Bonesingers is required to create large and complex items such as starships and Eldar Titans unless you are willing to sing alone for years. With enough time, perhaps, you could even sing forth a brand-new Craftworld but how and where would you acquire that much time? Even an Eldar is not immortal.
-From Trinitite to Powerstones (GURPS Technomancer) (400CP)
        The world of Technomancer does not stand still, and science marches forever onward, even when mana gets involved. And perhaps one of the best ways to march onward is to steal liberally from natural phenomena. You can, by examining a natural magical effect for a few days, figure out how to replicate that phenomena with a spell.


-Machine Madness (Dragon Ball GT) (400CP)
        So much of the universe relies on Ki to grant them power or natural biological abilities. Why pursue scientific perfection when you're already able to claim to be perfect? Why NOT pursue scientific perfection? Despite the lack of need, you buried yourself into science and found ways to use technology to match mysticism. So long as you have a good understanding of how a supernatural effect or technique or ability works, you are able to replicate it through technology, creating a device or being capable of performing that effect or technique or ability. The method, resources, cost and so on may change to fit the new medium but the ultimate result will be as if you had used that magical spell yourself...just through the lens of beautiful, beautiful science.


-Moon Tech (Okami) (400CP)
        While you aren't granted a full understanding of everything the Moon Tribe could do, you've been blessed with the basics, including the method to make the metal used in their constructions, and an intuitive understanding of the way the machinery functions. For the most part, the inner workings are mostly a mystery, though what is known is that they can run infinitely on their power source and are controlled by the spirit or divine power of the user. Examples of the greatest of their technology includes Yami's nearly unbreakable transforming robot body, a machine that generates freezing blizzards, and spaceships. Lesser works include most non-divine creations in the item section. This talent could quickly grow into so much more if you could only get your hands on enough Moon Tribe relics to experiment with or an expert to learn from.
        Indeed, this is all promised to you by Yami, along with dark power unending and rule in Nippon if only you swear fealty to him and devote yourself to his goal. After all, he has already granted you so much, and without even demanding your loyalty. As a bonus, Yami will even throw in the right to manifest his markings on your body. In appearance, they're simply a blue mirror of the celestial markings worn by Brush Gods. Try not to show it off to those few who've dealt with him before, as none will hesitate in slaying an agent of Yami. I'll leave the choice up to you.


-NovaTech (Trinity:Aberrant) (400CP)
        Nova powers can fill technological gaps, allowing for devices to be constructed that are decades ahead of the curve...even if those devices won't work for anyone but the Nova that made them. While mainly the domain of Mega-intelligent scientists, you've made strides into the field of using technology that amplifies or is fuelled by a Nova's innate powers. Perhaps this is as simple as a gauntlet that helps focus and strengthen Quantum Bolts, or as complex as a massive structure that allows for a Warp- capable Nova to reach a distant star system with their power.


-There's An App For That (UQ Holder) (400CP)
        Magic Apps are a recent invention, made to bring power to the people. They turn a magical spell into an electronic format that can be inserted into a Manaphone, a device to power the spells with electricity, and then freely use that magic without doing the training or energy normally needed. Amazing stuff and you're at the forefront of that new science. You're quite effortlessly able to translate any magical spell or Ki technique that you know into a Magic App, provided you have the proper facilities, regardless of how strange or powerful the magic may be. You do still need to power the spell with something once you turn it into an App but you're well versed in the creation of Manaphones and like devices too, so you can convert almost any kind of phone or computer to be able to cast apps too.


-DigiModify (Digimon World Re: Digitize) (600CP)
        No matter how great a creation might be; you can't plan for everything when you make it. The same goes for people; as even the most skilled warrior might run into problems such as their inability to walk on water. However, through the power of SCIENCE all things are possible!
        Through acts of technological wizardry you're capable of creating special 'programs' you can 'install' in both objects and living beings to modify their abilities, or how they interact with the environment. Something like water walking would be the work of a few hours of coding; while creating a false wall would take only a few minutes.
        Greater yet is the possibility of improving lifeforms. Such as finding ways to 'overclock' them for a significant but temporary boost in ability; though the strain such things may cause will require their cautious use and application. However, with patience and a dedicated subject you can study intimately it may be possible to chip away at a creatures limitations, or program new capabilities derived from their existing traits; slowly but surely improving them through incremental steps. Though take care when doing so, as the more that you push them with a single alteration the greater the risk you expose your subject to. That said, a little danger is nothing a brilliant mind like yourself is unfamiliar with.


-Digitized Sorcery (Fate/Extra) (600CP)
        The Magi of old had to adapt, converting the dying system of magecraft into something that could be used to their advantage within the Moon Cell. The results of their efforts are the Code Casts, a digital version of magecraft. Much like them, you can now convert magical systems into a technological variant. This will not be instant and will require a fair amount of research for you to accomplish, but it would let you find a new side to existing systems you possess.


-Magic is the Mother of Invention (The Magicians - TV Show) (600CP)
        It seems that you've been dabbling in the art of creating Magical objects, and have found yourself to be quite proficient at it! You're now a certified genius when it comes to creating and altering Magical objects, be they regularly enchanted or MagiTech, and you have enough base knowledge to create things such as state-of-the-art Magical batteries or warded objects on par with Brakebills University's wards. You invent and create new Magical objects incredibly quickly, and can easily deduce the purpose and method of usage of any Magical object given enough time.


-Magical Mechanic (Generic Buffy Fanfiction) (600CP)
        By definition, anything that exists as part of the universe is natural and is therefore subject to engineering no different than physics, chemistry, or biology. Cybernetic human/demon hybrids are certainly doable, as are computers that perform location spells and summon power from a massive reactor stored in a pocket dimension. Magic's erratic nature is never beyond a mathematical equation to account for the variance, and even spells that require a living being would easily accept one of your AIs.
        CAPSTONE BOOSTED: This now extends to any abilities you have. Your creations are inherently linked to you and are receptive to your powers. You may have trouble finding a way to provide enough energy to machines to let them wield your full power, but you at least have the means to imbue any ability, perk, or attribute into your creations.


-Magos Aetheric (Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus) (600CP)
        Though feared and maligned, the existence of the Imperium nonetheless depends upon exploiting the immaterium. Understanding it allows for travel, for communication, and to battle the daemonic on even terms. You have come to be one of the very few experts on the subject of the warp, and know how to manipulate it through technology. You can easily craft psy-implants that boost or suppress psychic powers, weaponry incorporating psychic components, or hexagrammatic wards. With enough time and resources you could build or even improve upon existing patterns of gellar field generators, warp drives, and immaterial sensors. You have even made inroads into understanding the genetic influence behind the manifestation of psyker, pariah and navigator abilities. This is not an easy path to tread, for the slightest misstep or moment of carelessness can see you damned, and even with the most exacting precautions it is a road fraught with peril.


-Mechanica (Ars Magica) (600CP)
        In medieval Europe, Heron of Alexandria was known mostly for his philosophical works, but he also produced extensive texts on mathematics, physics and mechanics, which inspired a group of mechanic-mages known as the Mechanicians. These Mechanicians created magical mechanical beings known as Mechanica, some of which even had human-level intelligence.
        This knowledge spread throughout much of the Eastern Roman Empire, but died out in the fifth century as a result of religious persecution. You now have the knowledge and skill to revive this tradition, being capable of building Mechanica yourself. While these can be designed to perform simple mechanical tasks, they can also duplicate spell effects, and, with extra effort, they can be awakened, granting them magic resistance, the intelligence of an average human and a personality based on their form and materials.
        For example, a mechanical snake might be deceptive and prone to telling lies, while a being made from iron may be particularly stubborn. A being awakened this way begins its life very loyal to its creator, and will likely remain that way as long as it is not mistreated. Creating Mechanica does not require vis despite the fact that they will operate indefinitely if kept safe and well-maintained. The components required for their construction are very expensive, however.


-Neo Engineer (Date a Live) (600CP)
        For better or worse, your talents are more important at the back of the battle rather than in the frontlines. You're an engineer of either AST or directly of DEM Industries. Developing and upgrading CR-Units and weapons is your trade and life, even the most complex and dangerous of suits or weapons are something easy to do. But, perhaps your true talent is the skill of uniting mana and technology with extreme freedom, making breakthrough after breakthrough as long as you have the resources. Who knows, maybe with enough data you could create an artificial spirit.


-Programming Miracles (Alterworld 2.4) (600CP)
        The metaphysics of this world allow for some interesting things to happen. Creating a fully realized dimension with its own malleable laws and rules is something common place though such a thing was never intentional. The Perma Effect caused many new worlds to spring into being from the playgrounds of humanity, video games become more than their intended distractions from reality and become real in themselves all through the power of belief and the divine spark of a human soul. By buying this perk you can take a little of this divinity with you, you become an able game designer and programmer. Someone who could create entire worlds from scratch with amazing amounts of detail. People would be astounded to see the worlds you create. This on its own is amazing but that is not all, by merely getting enough people to willingly play your game in your world you can slowly split it off into its own self contained world. The numbers are not low, requiring a large amount of people to play for extended amounts of time before your world begins to go from unreal to real. A minimum of 200,000 souls all playing in your world all believing in it and wishing it was real will be your lower threshold for such a feat, that is your minimum threshold to start an unreal world down its path become a real world of its own. Surely you can pull that off, yes? You can toggle this effect if you wish to simply craft some of the best games around and not have them become miniature world of them own I guess. If you were into that.


-Sparking Innovation (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - TG) (600CP)
Sparking Innovation (200CP)
        The fruits of hard work and study. By studying the arts of the ancient Sheikah, You can now create basic Ancient technology. The chief use of this is that you have the knowledge of creating the blue flame that acts as the energy source for much Sheikah Tech. This Blue Flame can be used to fuel various magitech as Sheikah devices are known to be, and in turn you are capable of creating simple tools such as cameras and recording devices with this level of knowledge. Nothing ground shaking on its own, but it's the base of even greater innovation
It Is Written (400CP)
        The use of mystical runes for enchanted effects is well known by those with a passing interest in the magical arts, but...the Sheikah were unique. They were able to create a language from runes that had conditional statements and effects. In short - the Sheikah could program with runes, thus allowing for programs to become spells. You have knowledge of this art as well - You are able to use Runes to code programs such as those used by the Sheikah Slate to perform its functions. This combined with Sparking Innovation would give you the groundwork to create your own variant of the Sheikah Slate with your own round of Runes...though magic doesn't make something simple - you'll need to create the code for these Slates yourself.


-The Science of Mysticism (D.Y.N. Freaks) (600CP)
        The wonders of human ingenuity will never cease, even in a supposedly cruel world like this. You've gained the knowledge to convert magical spells into data format and upload them into technological devices, allowing those devices to cast those spells by drawing on the power the device runs on. As they have been turned into code, you are able to also alter the way the spells work to a great extent by interacting with and altering that code. Whilst you do not have unlimited freedom with these changes, it's impossible to make the spell many times as powerful as before or take away the drawbacks entirely or turn it into an entirely different spell, you can alter many of its' mechanics and rules to better suit your purposes. Make a shield spell automatically activate in certain conditions or change an elemental spell from controlling fire into one controlling another of the basic elements such as wind or water.


-Vitriolic Craftsman | Demonic Bartender | Chalcanth | Purest Vitriol | Exotic Components (Exalted - The Infernals) (750CP)
        Vitriolic Craftsman (400CP)
        The artifacts of Malfeas differ on a fundamental level from those of Creation, and as such Infernal artisans have devised many techniques to create these infernal relics. The making of such artifacts requires the pure form of the dark and acrid liquid known as vitriol, and the binding of demons into these relics, dissolving their forms and integrating their still-living Essences into their creation.
        Under an infernal artisan's ministrations, pure vitriol serves as a catalyst. Objects bathed in it are seared free of weakness, making them as strong as any of Creation's magical materials; component parts flow together and intermingle, amalgamating into a unified whole. Where an artificer in Creation would spend months carving and shaping an artifact's components, his Malfean counterpart immerses them in vitriol and guides their slow, inextricable melding. Then, one slowly integrates the dissolved form of a living demon, known as Chalcanth or Azoth depending on their power, into the device's nascent structure.
        A demon must be of sufficient stature to match the power of a relic in order to bond with it, and likewise must its nature also accord with the relic's function if the procedure is to succeed. Now you too will join the ranks of hell's greatest artisans, with knowledge and skill that encompasses vitriol itself, the acids and catalysts derived from it and its use in the crafting of infernal relics.
        Your knowledge encompasses much understanding of demonic Essence, as well as the instinctive ability to use the appropriate mundane crafts to use together with vitriol as the catalyst. Bonding the Chalcanth to a Brass blade of your own design shall be a labor almost considered easy to an craftsman of your skill. Likewise the arts of demonic magi-technology and the creation and modification of life through vitalizing essence are known and practised by you, though their applications are somewhat more complex. As one of Hell's master artisans you may even surpass the limitations of the dull and feeble demonic essence contained within your creations, to instill them with a demonic will as a true Hellforged wonder with its own intellect and awakened essence.
        Demonic Bartender (Exalted - The Infernals) (200CP)
        Demons love their liquor. As water is extremely rare and milk nearly unknown in the demon realm, Hell instead offers a thousand infernal wines, whiskeys, brandies, vodkas and other drinks. Many of them contain other drugs, both natural and supernatural. Some are flat-out toxic to mortals. Still, those Exalts who cultivates an immunity to poison and cast-iron gullet can explore a world of strange intoxicants that range from gut-ripping vileness to soul-shuddering delight. You've gained an understanding on how to create all these brews yourself. How to ferment bone-wine, thanachvil, and gurshant. How to distill liquid emotions and waking dreams derived from Hegra's rains into elixirs. How to bottle the perfect pleasure that is sypax, or the liquid Lethe of final rest elixir... and finally, even the most precious drink in all of Malfeas, chalcanth. chalcanth is the liquefied, distilled essence of a demon. The unfortunate demon is dissolved in pure vitriol while still alive, so that drinking chalcanth is like tasting pure Being to a demon, and grants both Essence and memories to any who drink it. Of course if you'd prefer, it could also be used in forging infernal relics, by far the most common artifacts in hell.
        Chalcanth (50CP)
        The life force of a demon preserved in vitriol, chalcanth appears as a cupful of vibrant liquid. The color and consistency of any given dose varies with its origin, but the fluid always stirs restlessly of its own accord and issues a faint susurrus, as the demon liquified in its creation still lives. Chalcanth's primary purpose is the creation of infernal relics, but that is not its only use. Many in Malfeas seek it out as an intoxicating source of essence, because if one drinks it they will be energized as the flavors of the demon's mind and soul tumble through the drinker's brain in a synesthetic wash of images and emotions. With one purchase of this, you will gain a cupful of high quality Chalcanth once every five days.
        Purest Vitriol (50CP)
        Passive and reactive in nature, Vitriol was designed by the Primordials to catalyze evolutionary transformation in matter and Essence. But in the millennia since the Primordial War, the Yozis' loathing for their jailers, their captivity, and their own broken natures has permeated the very nature of vitriol, infusing it with their hate. Now, it consumes all that it encounters. The stuff bubbles in open pits laden with the detritus of all that it has dissolved, and these impurities must be removed before the vitriol may be used for magical purposes. With one purchase of this, you will gain a weekly supply of enough pure Vitriol to dissolve a demon in or baptise one relic smaller than a vehicle.
        Exotic Components (50CP)
        Artificers of hell construct their relics with a greater pool of exotic reagents than those of Creation-made artifacts, for the world-bodies of the Yozi are rich with alien metals, stones and woods, not to mention the tissues and excretions of countless species of lesser demons, animals, plants and other entities that mortal savants might not even recognize as life. Of course, while these many be easy to come across in hell itself, not all Infernals have the luxury of staying there whenever they work on their relics. So with one purchase of this, you will gain a starting wealth of exotic components and an additional weekly supply of more than enough to construct a lesser relic, straight from the Demon Realm.


-Computation Creation | Magical Science (Youjo Senki - Saga of Tanya the Evil) (800CP)
Computation Creation (400CP)
        The operation orb - or computation orb, if you prefer - is a masterwork of science and mathematics. A unique crystalline and clockwork structure allows for mathematical code to be stored - called spells - and channels energy from the user in order to empower them. You now understand not just how they work, but why - and in doing so, can apply the principles to other aims. Magic is currently used solely by the air corps for long range bombardment. Let's fix that, shall we?
Magical Science (400CP)
        You are the forefront of mage technology, and can easily improve on what is currently being used, with some effort you can also build far more powerful mage tech. Whatever faction you belong to is sure to value you greatly.


-Thing of Wonder | Foaly? Koboi? Jumper (Artemis Fowl) (1100CP)
        Thing of Wonder (500CP)
        You're brilliant. That's just the best way to say it. You are simply an incredibly, unbelievably clever person. Your memory is a thing of wonder, with unlimited storage, perfect indexing and recall. You have a perfect sense of time and schedules, being able to keep perfect track of any number of things at all times. Your brain and nervous system is such that your thoughts can travel ridiculously, mind-bogglingly fast, giving you a peerless speed of processing info. You can control this, to prevent going nuts from boredom if nothing else. Not that you would, your patience is inexhaustible and infinite, though your reflexes remain sharp through any length of time. You can focus on any number of things at once, working at all of them as if you were working on that thing alone. Your analysis and comprehension skills are similarly ridiculous, being practically miraculous. Patterns and puzzles unravel in front of you, revealing their secrets almost as if they want to, to you. You can analyze legal cases, codes, riddles and puzzles, conspiracies and schemes, and break them in less time than it takes most people to figure out what is happening at all. There is no code you can't break, no pattern you can't identify. This perk is a Capstone Booster, meaning it enhances each of the origin capstones if taken with this. The details are mentioned in the perk descriptions.
        Foaly Koboi Jumper (600CP)
        You're a genius among geniuses, in technology and magic both. Your technological skill is such that you find it child's play to create gadgets and weapons like Bio-Bombs, or the technological wonders that are LEP uniforms, or small devices that make toy cars nuclear-powered. You can even improve them or come up with more tech of similar levels, if not even more advanced. You're also a hacker of absolutely unmatched skill, capable of slicing through any and all systems, firewalls and defenses like a knife through butter, bending networks and websites to your will, and all the rest that comes with it. It doesn't matter how advanced or sophisticated it is, if it's electronic or digital and it can be accessed at all, you can penetrate all aspects of it until you control it outright - it's just a matter of time and effort. And very little of either, really. Your skills at magic are nothing less, either. Well, if you can do it at all. If you can, then your talent is nothing short of legendary, allowing you to master spells and rituals that would take other a lifetime in days, if not less. Your skills are distributed equally in all fields of magic, so much so that any advancement in one area automatically improves the others too. You could do things like study necromancy for a month and come out tossing lightning bolts like a pro.
        Capstone Boost Both your scientific and magical abilities get a massive boost, advancing you several times over in both fields. In addition, they work together now, making you an expert in making technology that mimics magic and vice-versa. You know how to create both technology and magic to do anything and everything you yourself are capable of doing. Spells to replace devices, vice-versa, and products that use both, that is, techno-magic. You're also capable of reverse engineering any and all magic and technology you encounter, now. No matter how advanced the tech or how obscure the magic, how powerful and complicated they may be, all you need is one look at any magic or technology to know the underlying principles under it, and how to recreate, modify and improve it in a hundred different ways.


-Mega Bomb | Guru (Chrono Trigger) (1200CP)
        Mega Bomb (600CP)
        Magic and Technology are both capable of some pretty fantastic things. So why not put them together, and see what happens? You now understand the secret to integrating magic seamlessly into your mechanical devices, enabling you to create devices like bombs powered with fire magic or medkits that use healing magic. While initially your devices will be one-shots that rely on a magical charge you have to deliver, in time, you'll learn how to make much more advanced fusions, such machines that run on magical power sources, or automated spellcasting devices. In the end, the only limit is your skill with machinery and magic.
        Guru (600CP)
        Back in the glory days of Zeal, Guru was a title reserved only for the most skilled and knowledgeable of their mages and scientists. You might not be there yet, but when I'm done with you, you'll be well on your way to deserving the title. Magic is akin to a science to you, letting you delve into the secrets of sorcery the same way a physicist would unlock the secrets of the atom. This also includes learning how to apply magical knowledge like an engineer does the sciences, letting you come up with breathtaking magical wonders. The Blackbird, the Mammon Machine, the Ocean Palace - who knows what you'll add to that list of legends.


-Device Meister | Mysterious Serum | Ancient Knowledge (Lyrical Nanoha) (1300CP)
        Device Meister (600CP)
        This is the real treasure of the TSAB's technological capabilities - mixing the use of magic and technology inorder to create Devices that can channel the energy outwards. You have a complete knowledge of how to build and maintain Devices, along with how to program AI for said Devices to use.
        While you can construct most Devices and similar items presented here, the ability to make Unison Devices isn't included here - you'll have to learn that one on your own, and many have tried and failed to do so in the past. You could, with some experimentation, combine different magical systems into Devices together, especially with the help of 'SimilarPrinciples' to streamline the process...it will take some trial and error, but you could apply these principles and Devices to other systems if you work at it enough.
        Mysterious Serum (300CP)
        Fascinating. These test tubes contain a colorless serum that, when ingested, allow one to 'awaken' the Linker Cores of sentient beings, allowing them to naturally use this world's magic after a little bit of training with it. Note that individuals like Nanoha are exceptions to the rule, and will be in future worlds as well - unless they had a particular affinity for magic or some way to boost their arcane power, you're unlikely to find anyone who starts with a Natural Ability higher than A. You receive eight of these, along with the formula on how to create more - though it's encoded and you'll have to decipher it. If you have 'Ancient Knowledge', you already know how to make more on your own from the get-go. Magical ability growth for individuals outside of this world tend to plateau at S-rank on their own. Bear that in mind.
        Ancient Knowledge (400CP)
        The legacy of the Belkan Empire exists not merely within ruins or Lost Logia, but in the blood of its people. You have inherited a bloodline of note, and while it may or may not be one of the canonical or major bloodlines, a piece of it has followed you in your very DNA, subconsciously nudging at your memory. While this creates no stress or strain on your personality, the connection is diluted enough that you can't consciously access this memory...but when you come into contact with Lost Logia, you will rapidly gain insight into how it functions and possibly ways to engineer it once again. You will need actual technical skills to pull this off, but with a little bit of time, perhaps you can restore what is lost? Post-jump, this same insight applies to 'lost' or 'forgotten' technology, though you will likely need other sources of knowledge and abilities to truly restore it, depending on its complexity. May or may not come with brief instances of acting and speaking like a resident of the Belkan Empire at random intervals.


-Magical Coding | Coding Station | Spell Compendium | CAD Tuning | Taurus Silver (The Irregular At The Magic Highschool) (1400CP)
        Magical Coding (100CP)
        The Activation Sequences used to enact Modern magic are made up of large blocks of code translated into Magic Sequences by the Magician's Magic Calculation Area. You know the basics of this world's coding methods, allowing you to program simple Activation Sequences into a CAD and create simple hacking programs.
        Coding Station (200CP)
        This is the workhorse of a Magic Engineer, being their main 'battle station' so to speak. This large desk comes equipped with an integrated computer and CAD connection system to code Sequences into CADs and tune them to their user. It also possesses a simple VI system to make coding easier and more efficient. Includes a CAD can take almost any form you want, from a bracelet to a pendant to a stick, and store up to 99 different Activation Sequences though it's usually less precise than a specialized CAD.
        Spell Compendium (100CP)
        This small PDA-like device contains a large selection of Activation and Magic Sequences for your personal use. Secret or unique Sequences cannot be included in this selection.
        CAD Tuning (400CP)
        Tuning a CAD to the specifics of its owner's Psion wave profile enables it to function at peak efficiency, reducing Psion waste and improving connectivity. You can do the same for most artifacts you own, calibrating them to improve their connections to you, slightly boosting their power and efficiency.
        Taurus Silver (600CP)
        Taurus Silver is a noun collectively used by two different people, Tatsuya Shiba and Ushiyama, and is the head of the Third Division of Four Leaves Technology, with Tatsuya handling the software side and Ushiyama the hardware side. You are now of the same caliber as them, being either a very effective professional code-builder or engineer, capable of assembling new forms of codes or creating new types of machines capable of grand things when brought together, like Tatsuya's Loop Cast System or Ushiyama's Silver Series CADs. If taken with Strategic-Class Magician, you can have both specialties at higher levels than even Tatsuya of Ushiyama, and you also gain a powerful affinity for magitech of all forms.


-MineFactory Reloaded | Industrialcraft | Buildcraft | Railcraft | Lore of Alex | Nethereye (Minecraft) (1450CP)
        MineFactory Reloaded (600CP)
        Your understanding of magic is complete. To you, magic is engineering, and can be automated and reproduced on an Industrial scale... at a considerable cost in life, as this sort of magitech runs not merely on Electricity, but also on the life Essence extracted from the bodies of the dying. This liquid Essence permits the manufacture of potions and enchanted items on an automated assembly line, or the breakdown of enchanted items into Essence and component materials. This can even extend to potions and enchanted items from other universes, provided you have mastered the relevant techniques, and have enough of the required raw materials to make automation worthwhile.
        IndustrialCraft (400CP)
        Working your way up from simple machines, you are able to build a vast array of advanced machinery, from the humble ore grinding Macerator, to the futuristic Mass Fabricator. In time, you'll be able to build automated factory complexes, supply all your power needs with nuclear energy, protect yourself with nigh impervious Quantum Armour, teleport between bases with ease, and terraform vast areas to suit your whims.
        Buildcraft (200CP)
        You aren't limited to building things yourself given some basic supplies and some redstone, you can use a system of gears and tubes to automate your crafting tables, create an item sorting system, and build massive automated quarries capable of stripping the land of all resources down to the bedrock. It'll take a bit to get started, but once you're up and running, you'll be sure to have all the resources you need.
        Railcraft (100CP)
        Instead of the crude minecart tracks you were able to make before, you are now able to make properly sturdy rails, able to bear the weight of full Steampowered trains that can pull a variety of useful carts. Using a system of tracks and automatic loader/unloaders, you can automate the delivery of resources and liquids from one place to another, or deploy 'railgun' systems to launch explosive filled carts at your enemies! You can even create trains which automatically build their own tracks, or which dig tunnels for you. You'll also be able to make massive steam boilers, with which you can power your Buildcraft devices far more efficiently... given a nontrivial setup process.
        Lore of Alex (100)
        You know the mystic secrets of this world, and can easily assemble a portal to the Nether, given a supply of Obsidian. Should you acquire the necessary hellish reagents there, you'll be able to brew a number of useful magical potions. Additionally, whenever you kill something, glowing orbs will emerge from the corpse, which will float towards you if you are close enough with enough of these (and a diamond studded Enchanting Table), you'll be able to enchant items with a variety of simple magical powers. It is notable that all these effects work generally in this world, and anyone can learn them here you just know it all from the start, and will be able to apply these effects with confidence in other worlds, or to things not normally found in this world. For instance, you'll be able to judge the enchantment capacity of arbitrary items with a glance, and that amount will be greater for you than it might be for other magi.
        Nether Eye (50)
        You'll be able to craft Nether Eyes from Ender Pearls and Magma Cream, which will allow you to easily locate Nether Fortresses, when you visit the Nether. You'll also have a pretty solid grasp of Overworld/Nether geometry, thus allowing you to 'safely' use Nether Portals as 'shortcuts' between distant parts of the overworld. Additionally, Nether Portals will work in nonMinecraft worlds, guaranteeing you access to Nether only resources like Glowstone and Nether Wart. Caution: use of Nether Portals in universes which contain actual hell dimensions may send you there instead.
        * Buildcraft, Industrialcraft and lore of alex are all required to make minefactory reloaded work. Railcraft and nethereye could be removed if wanted. This would save 150CP. They are add ons to buildcraft and lore of alex




 --- Domain: Skills: Magic (25) (51 Perks) --- 


-Magic Style: Arc of Embodiment (Fairy Tail) (100CP)
        It's time to choose the Magical Styles that you have already learned upon entering this world. Whilst most magical styles can be learned with time and effort and the right teacher or source of knowledge, buying them here will allow them to benefit from the skill that Magic Skill ranks grant as well as allow access to extremely rare or lost magics or magics that require certain traits to use. A list of the magics that can be bought as well as their costs can be found at the end of the jump document. It should be noted that some Magic Styles will not be purchaseable through this option. Most of these are Holder Type magics, which all deal with magical items that are offered for purchase in the item section, and some are simply Caster Type magics that are too unique and either offered as part of a separate perk or not at all. This may change in the future as the series progresses or not.


-Old Patient Magic (Circle of Magic) (100CP)
        You have learned how to cast charms, wards, and protections over places that grow more and more powerful, stable, and harder to damage with age. A door you reinforced with magic a year ago will be tougher than one you reinforced a day ago, and a scrying mirror you made decades ago will be able to see further than one you made a couple years back. The growth rate may not be much, and it grows slower over time, but it does add up over decades and centuries.


-Anima (Ravenwood) (200CP)
        The power of your own soul. Wisps of spiritual energy bound to yourself, able to be shaped into quasi-physical garb or used to reinforce that which you already possess. Each shaped bit or aspect of yourself acts as a receptacle for the wisps you possess, and filling them increases the strength provided, but limits the amount you can put elsewhere. However, it only takes a few moments, vital in any battle, to shift these wisps around and change the boons they provide.


-Common Magic (Nexus 2.0) (200CP)
        Light is something everyone has, regardless if they are a fighter or not. As such, even the most common laborer will use it to their advantage. You find your abilities are easier to use when turned towards a profession that doesn't involve fighting. Crafting, farming, construction, cooking, and any other profession is able to benefit from your various abilities with great ease.


-Conceptual Fertilization (Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon) (200CP)
        The secret art of Conceptual Fertilization is one that may seem a bit strange and even unnatural to those not as invested as you in the mystic arts but...well, they don't complain so much when you show them the results. Conceptual Fertilization refers to a very rare magical ability that allows one to combine two things during the creation process of one of those things, transferring the qualities of the second thing onto the first. Combining the blood of a dragon with a infant in the womb to grant them the magical power of that dragon as they grow up, for instance. With time and further mastery, it may even be possible to combine more than one thing in this way, though one cannot begin to think of the sacrifices the failed attempts might cause. Additionally, you find that you are also able to perform this process on other things in their creation process, not just living beings, allowing you to infuse weapons or other objects in the process of being created with the traits of other things.


-External Influence (E.V.O. Search for Eden) (200CP)
        Creepy. You can now use your EVO and any relevant perks to evolve creatures and beings other than yourself. The cost to do so is less than it would take for you to make the same changes, letting you change small handfuls of individuals at a time for the same cost. This ability only works on willing or helpless targets.


-Kiln (Ravenwood) (200CP)
        You are what is known as a Kiln, capable of wielding Delfire. Often called scavenger's magic, Delfire is the combination of different forms of magic that has taken on new properties, becoming a small orb surrounded by an oddly colored flame-like aura. This is the source of delfire's name, and they do not emphasize fire over any other element. You are able to store these orbs of delfire within yourself, giving you resistance to disease, poison, curses, and corruption as it is eaten away by the delfire. Additionally, delfire acts as a spell matrix, capable of producing unusual effects when fueled by any type of energy. If you possess the Natural Magic perk, you may create orbs of Delfire by mixing various energies together. Post jump, you will be able to come across new orbs of Delfire naturally if you wish, however it is up to you whether the delfire spawns in the setting.


-The Dark Crystal (Azeroth) (200CP)
        Draenei use crystals that are, possibly, native to their homeworld for almost all aspects of their daily lives. Even their technology, magic, and homes are made of these crystals. Certain Artificers are capable of 'Programming' these crystals to do certain things ranging from protecting an entire city in a shield or powering magitek spaceships that can travel the void of space. You now have their knowledge of these ancient arts and are capable of incorporating this magitek into your own technology or magic.


-Rainbow Notes (Mermaid Melody Pichi Pichi Pitch) (300CP)
While mermaids are superior singers, humans invented the art of song to begin with.  You are now gifted in the art of music composition, and can creatively piece together the notes and lyrics for new songs effortlessly.  In fact, your songs are good enough such that, when sung or played by a magical being such as a mermaid, or someone with magical music like a fantasy bard, they have magical powers of their own.  And the greatest thing about music is that it is a treasure that can be shared with anyone.  You can teach your songs, even magical ones, to companions and other pupils willing to learn.  Please also note that the perk also applies to other musical forms outside of singing, such as the piano, as well as other things such as dancing, prayers, and spell chants.


-Signum Linguistics (Skulduggery Pleasant v1.05) (300CP)
        Also called Symbol Magic. It's one of China Sorrows' specialties. Harnesses a magical language to produce a wide variety of effects. Fairly unique in that it can be learned by anyone, even if they've already chosen their discipline. As such, this magic can be purchased regardless of how many others you've bought already, even without Multidisciplinary Magic.
        Sorrows: Your talent is equal to that of China Sorrows, the world's most well-known user of this discipline. With this, you have become capable of producing greater effects than before. From producing waves of energy to masquerading as another, you can do it all. You can even carve sigils into your very body without a single worry of a mistake. Using this power, you could even seal others' True Names, provided they meet the requirements for doing so, of course. What you can do now is virtually limitless, as long as you know the right runes. And if the runes you want don't exist, you can always just invent your own.


-Ambient Magic: Cooking (Circle of Magic) (400CP)
        A form of Fire Magic, Chef Magic draws power from all aspects of cooking and the manipulation of fire. A Chef Mage's senses of taste and smell are incredibly precise, able to accurately judge both contents and quantities of ingredients. A Chef mage can, in defiance of that age old adage, pull some or all of an ingredient out of a dish with enough concentration. They can enhance flavors, healthiness, or even how much sustenance someone gains. They are also extremely skilled with knives. It is practiced by Jorality Bancanor, Olennika Potcracker, and Gorse.


-Ambient Magic: Glass (Circle of Magic) (400CP)
        A form of Fire Magic, in which the user creates unique glass objects with magical abilities (eg. scrying orbs or tracker / warning pellets), as well as identification of glass works without sight through the piece's own knowledge of its form. It is practiced by Kethlun Warder. Glassmages can make lenses and mirrors that grant extrasensory abilities, such as the ability to see magic or track footprints. They can also make warded or incredibly strong windows.


-Ambient Magic: Painting (Circle of Magic) (400CP)
        Although nothing is known of them, it is known that there are Ambient Mages with power over Painting, Pottery, Horses, and Birds. Rumors say there is also an Ambient Magic of Hunting, but that may be little more than legend.


-Aura Surgeon (World Seed) (400CP)
        One thing that all beings and objects in Neolife possess, and soon those in the real world as well, considering that exposure to mana leads to its manifestation, is an Aura. You could consider it a magical blueprint of how something works. And it truly shows everything: skills, abilities, physical makeup, personality, memory, and much more. Animals and plants have flowing auras, full of twists and turns, whereas processed items like machines have jagged auras, full of hard lines like a 3D circuit diagram. One peculiarity of Aura is that any of its changes are reflected in the being or object possessing the Aura. Xeno-shifters, an advanced Druid class, make use of that to mimic the aura of lifeforms they have studied in order to gain both their forms and abilities, for example.
        It is also how Technomancers are able to replicate the effects of implants within themselves, by simply copying their Auras into their bodies. But for all of its potential advantages, tampering with your own Aura can also go incredibly wrong if you mess it up, especially when it involves your brain, such as causing brain damage, death of personality, or just the normal kind of death. It's good, then, that with your skill at manipulating and changing Auras, yours and those of others, mistakes like that won't ever happen. It wouldn't be wrong to call you an Aura Artisan.
        So long as you have an example to study, you'll be able to safely and successfully apply any of its abilities or peculiarities either to yourself or somebody else, and even combine parts of the Auras of many beings to create truly powerful forms. After studying a massive amount of different Auras to get a feel for how they work, you'll even be able to go so far as to create original Auras and beings, or change parts of your Aura to give yourself entirely new abilities.


-Developing Power Lines (Ah My Goddess) (400CP)
Earth Lines are the very core of a Earth Spirits power; also known as Dragon Streams, Earth Power Veins, Leylines, and Life Streams. These are the natural flows of the world’s core energy, called Earth energy but it's nearly indistinguishable with magical and spiritual energy, the very source of a Earth Spirits power and the connection they have with the world. Whilst it is true that most Earth Lines are immobile and new ones don't appear, without the intervention of a powerful Earth Spirit, God, or Demon you thankfully are a strong enough spirit to do so. You're roughly equal to a God(dess) of the Second Class in raw power and able to move existing lines around to be more in tune with urbane developments or even produce new lines, though such an act would be hugely draining upon the you, on the level of spiritually and magically draining yourself completely in one go to be exact. These Earth Lines can be tapped into by Earth Spirits like yourself, or maybe if your nice and grant permission a few others could gain some benefits of these mystic lines of power, but only an Earth Spirit could use the power found in the Earth Lines to its full potential and non Earth Spirits will find the power on par with a diminished Third Class Earth Spirit.


-Forged Of Gods (Dungeon Keeper Ami) (400CP)
        The powers of the light have their own strengths of course, among those is the ability to create hero gates through which no evil may pass, you also can now create these portals, with enough preparation it is possible to create hero gates strong enough to pass a small army through. This also grants you the knowledge of how to craft weapons and items out of adamantine, a metal that is made of the remains of a dead god, and even allows you to forge otherwise unbreakable metals as if they were steel.


-Magic Prodigy (Monster Girl Encyclopedia) (400CP)
You have a gift with magic that comes all too rarely to generations. You can easily learn different schools of magic that have been created, and you are able to find innovative ways to effectively use even spells that are normally marginalized as useless.  Furthermore, you are now able to learn and use any of the magic spells existing in the MGE setting without needing spirit or demon energy for it to work.  You start out with a fair knowledge of and aptitude for all the myriad of magic school – archaeomancy (the orthodox magic system), hieromancy (holy/light/divine rituals traditionally used by clerics/heroes of the Chief God), necromancy (life/death magic), nymphomancy (succubus magic), pharmacomancy (healing) teletomancy (extra-big/strong spells), theriomancy (“beast” physical enhancement), etc. – and if you take the time I’m sure you’ll find more schools and develop your skills further, with the potential to eventually master the full depth of each art.


-Merge (Gemcraft Frostborn Wrath) (400CP)
        Want a bigger, better, badder copy of something you already have? Look no further. This allows you to permanently merge items together, even CP items, but the more dissimilar they are, the more potential power is lost in the merge. Two magic swords would usually stack their power, but a magic sword and a magic bow combining would be reduced to one form and reduce the power of the final item a fair amount, though it would still be more powerful than either original. You can't do more than double the power of the strongest original item merged in this way, but you could add lots of bells and whistles that don't directly make it more powerful such as additional elemental affinities. Items that are designed to be merged (like gems) do not have the limitation of doubling their starting power, so if you merge 64 level one gems, you will end up with a level 6 gem.


-Mystic Eyes of Permanence (Generic Isekai) (400CP)
        Your unusual blood has manifested in the form of a unique set of eyes. These eyes give you the ability to see the structure of magical effects, and spend your own mana to optimize those effects, extending their duration indefinitely. You can create magical flames that burn without fuel, force walls that endure for years, enchantments that never fade, perpetual constructs, and more. Magic you create or modify with the Eyes can still be broken or dispelled, but will remain forever if left undisturbed.


-Natural magic (Ravenwood) (400CP)
        People are not the only things afflicted with the corruptive influence of the Demiplane, the trees, the stone, the metal, everything possesses some degree of taint from this cursed plane of existence. And now you can use that to your advantage. You possess an innate understanding towards the mystical properties of nearly all materials within (and outside) the Demiplane, and how to shape them. By cutting gems, forming metal, grinding stone, and putting all the disparate pieces together, you can create artificial spell matrices that naturally generate and collect magical energies and can shape them into spell effects. While not often the prettiest things around, these artifacts are capable of granting magic to even the uninitiated. However, it takes precise craftsmanship and extensive design periods to make even basic items.
        This perk also extends to the creation of potions. These are much simpler to create compared to artifacts, requiring only the right herbs, water, and a catalyst of magical energy, which can be provided by even the most basic of spell matrices. Additionally, any similar skills in future jumps, can be replicated with study using this perk.


-Portal Creation (Generic Builder) (400CP)
        While every Builder can eventually learn to create portals through research or scanning enough other examples, you start knowing how to craft portals and you're particularly good at doing it cheaply both in terms of magic and in terms of material. Not only that but you have a knack for creating portals with interesting access restrictions that are almost impossible to bypass if you so choose.


-Portalist (Timespinner) (400CP)
        Vilete once knew the secret for making portals that were capable of spanning interplanetary distances, and now, you know that secret as well. You have the knowledge and skill to be able to craft portals between different locations in space. Something within the range of a city can be done 'freestyle', using only your own Aura, though you may need to charge up energy beforehand. Longer range portals would need anchors and magical focuses, but you know how to craft such very easily. Through practice and study, the range of your personal portals and permanent portals can both expand, with personal portals eventually reaching intercontinental distances, while your permanent portals could eventually reach between stars.


-Power! Unlimited Power! (Lords of the Nights - Liches) (400CP)
        While many Liches eventually become true believers in the cause, that's not how they started out. Their roots go back to hidden corners where a young wizard with more ambition and curiosity than sense discovered lore they weren't ready for, and started off on a journey to seize true might. Maybe some grow beyond that, but most don't. Whatever is the case, your magical growth is potent and many faceted. You can craft anything a mortal wizard could - any feat of craftsmanship short of the epic is yours. The understanding is solid enough to act as a prerequisite for you seeking more transcendent craftsmanship.
        You may also freely add a certain level of metamagic to anything you cast - up to the same limit as what you can cast normally. A Wizard who can cast fourth level spells could freely add up to four circles worth of metamagic without making the spell harder to cast. This empowerment doesn't need to happen in advance, and can instead be applied to spells as they are cast, taking no extra time to do so. Lastly, whenever they deepen their connection to the Arcane, more aspects of magic reveal themselves. Every Arcane 'Feat' they achieve, helps them achieve another three feats of magic - Metamagic, Reserve, Spell Penetration, or something else appropriate.


-Seed Weaving (Nexus 2.0) (400CP)
        The technique known as Seed Weaving is an advanced form of Seed Sorcery, specifically in the creation of the Seed itself. You cycle Seeds around and through each other, effectively linking them into a sort of braid, which has the effect of growing each Seed slightly faster. However, the main benefit of this technique lies in the increased flexibility, as each Seed may be Cracked to fuel each other rather than simply their own effect, even combining their effects if multiple Seeds are Cracked at once. This technique also frees any Seeds so they may move within the user's Light, allowing it to be moved and used to enhance the body when it normally wouldn't be able to, a fact that makes hunters that know this technique quite dangerous to fight as they can maintain far more Seeds than more restricted Seed Sorcerers. The process to learn this technique is difficult, requiring years of training to accomplish, and most won't be able to do more than a single Weaving at once. You, however, are skilled in the technique, able to weave up to four Seeds in a single Weaving and up to three such Weavings at the same time. You may teach others to use this technique.


-Thaumcraft (Minecraft) (400CP)
        You are a powerful mage, and can break items down into their pure Aspects, then reweave those Aspects into more useful forms. With time and research, you'll be able to transmute items into other items, create powerful magical items, imbue wands with spells both useful and deadly, and create golem servitors to carry out your whims. Beware, though; Thaumaturgy is a delicate art, and any mistakes can Taint the land, twisting the land to evil and all creatures within it into deadly and malicious forms. The Thaumonomicon, a magical book you'll create early on in your research, will help you get started, and give hints as to what to do next.


-The Ancient Music (Dishonored 2) (400CP)
        Underlying all of reality and even the Void is a musical phenomenon, and study of this underpinning force is something you have devoted your life so far to. As a result, you can design and build devices to take advantage of a 17-note scale derived from this music - the orgels the Overseers hold in such high regard being the most obvious application. If you are able to reproduce the notes correctly, they will disrupt the effect of foul magicks around you - actually, any magicks at all, foul or fair. Singing bone charms will become silent, witches will no longer be able to draw on their supernatural oddities, and creatures made with magic - partially or whole - will be unable to approach you while the notes play. With the right device, you can even use the scale to project blasts of sound to knock back and disorient witches who keep their distance. While the effect is a blanket one, disrupting all magic, friend's or foe's, with significant research you could discover harmonies or sub-scales in order to affect only certain types of magic.


-Spiritual Array Master | Book of Array Diagrams | Cultivation (The Great Ruler) (500CP)
        Spiritual Array Master (400CP)
        Making a Spiritual Array is simply a special method of resonating Spiritual Energy. It will activate the Spiritual Aura within the world, creating both offensive and defensive measures. Spiritual Arrays are made up of Spiritual Seals. The more powerful and talented someone is, the more seals they can make. The more complex the array, the more seals are needed. Seal masters are divided into 9 ranks, 1 to 9, each much harder to reach than the last, though the actual ranks are slightly more complicated after the 5th rank. Few people will even be able to reach the 5th rank. Despite it sounding simple, once you get to the threshold of a rank making the next seal becomes much harder, similar to making a breakthrough in cultivation.
        You have been trained up to 3rd rank, able to create more than 100 seals. Nothing groundbreaking but impressive nonetheless. But you also have an advantage that would make many envious; you have the potential to enter the Heart Array State at will, allowing you to improve your array skills extremely quickly, as well as increasing your ability in its use while in the state. Keep training and you can eventually enter the higher forms of it like the Heart Eye State which greatly increases your array capability.
        Book of Array Diagrams (100CP)
        Having the ability to create and summon array seals is all well and good, but it is next to useless if you do not know any of the ways to arrange them in order to create an array. There are hundreds of different kinds of arrays one can make and a single misstep will cause your array to collapse. This book that you have found yourself with contains the formula for several arrays of your skill level. This book also gives details into creating your own arrays and a bit into how they work. A good starter guide if you ever wanted to teach others. These arrays will range from defensive ones, to attacking ones, to illusion ones.
        Cultivation (0CP)
        You gain the ability to cultivate, starting off at the Spiritual Movement Stage. The cultivation of the Great Thousand Worlds is Spiritual Power. If you happen to have already cultivated Dou Qi from Battle Through The Heavens, you will find that the Dou Qi has the unique ability to convert itself into the purer Spiritual Power. This means that you can essentially choose to integrate your two cultivations together and boost your Spiritual Power to high levels immediately, or keep them separate. The cultivation of the Thousand Worlds goes several realms higher than that of Dou Qi, so it can become much stronger. There are 12 stages of the cultivation of Spiritual Power, with each stage being split into a variety of levels. In the more backwater places, you would be lucky to find someone who has reached the level of Heavenly Fusion, while in the more populated areas it is not uncommon to find Sovereign class cultivators.
        In the Spirit Stage of the Spiritual Energy cultivation path, one has the ability to ingest the Soul Essence of a Spiritual Beast. However, there is a limit to the Soul Essence. As you get stronger, the Soul Essence that you have refined before will gradually lose its effect. This means that most essences will lose their effect before the Heavenly Completion Stage. However, if the Soul Essence that you have refined is powerful enough, the power will still remain even in the later level, giving those that have them an edge.
        Reaching the Sovereign Stage marks a major change in your cultivation. One must pass through 3 'disasters' where your body, energy, and soul are refined to a higher grade, yet failure is easy and can carry fatal consequences. Once you reach pass these trials and reach the Sovereign stage you will gain the Sovereign Sea, which is a much more powerful container for your Spiritual Power. The spiritual energy itself of Sovereign Masters possesses unique attributes. Some people's spiritual energies are cold in nature, and some are blazing hot. This is because their spiritual energies have their own sagacities depending on what kind of energies they take in and have attuned it to.
        Sovereigns also gain the ability to cultivate a Sovereigns Body which, depending on the rank, can give them great physical power. There are certain Celestial Body techniques one can cultivate to gain a more powerful Sovereigns Body, though they are often closely guarded secrets of clans.
        By pouring your Spiritual Power into someone else, you can awaken their ability to cultivate, not that that will do them much good without further guidance.


-Celestial Kabbalah (Unsong) (600CP)
        You have a deep understanding of the relationships between higher powers and base reality, the mechanisms that make the intangible tangible. What this means for you is that you can intuitively perceive the operations and organizational forces underpinning the universe around you; this includes conventional physics, but also more abstract forces such as destiny, Adam Kadmon, narrative causality, the operations of any magic systems, and more. With this deep insight, you can reach into the beating heart and grinding gears of these forces if you dare and manipulate them, or even carry out works of truly cosmic engineering. You might hedge out natural law, alter the parameters of a magic system and adjust its limits, rejigger the mechanisms of fate and destiny, or even run your own universe by means of magic or technology.


-Crystal Magic (Avernum) (600CP)
        The magic of the Vahnatai a hidden and enigmatic race, you can manipulate Crystals to use them for magic. It is a powerful art, capable of making anything from magical grenades, to Crystals that act as a focus for magic, to even enshrining a person's soul into a crystal, and more.


-Crystal Working (Geneforge) (600CP)
        You intrinsically know how to work crystals and form them into useful magical systems, if you observe such a system you would know how to recreate it, and likely how to make it better. This will work on any magic that you understand, as a bonus you know how to create the intricate crystal systems that are part of the geneforge.


-Doctor Stylish (Medaka Box Abnormal) (600CP)
        Styles are quite special, even among Skills. Makeable, if you know the right way, and capable of just as much power and even some things Skills cannot do. You're a Stylist equal to Fukurou, the creator of Styles, himself. Just by constantly using, considering and playing with a certain phrase, idiom, way of using words or other word-related game, you can create new styles. Things on the level of Provocation Style might take just a few weeks whilst a mid-level style like Label User or Kanji user might take months of repetition. The high level stuff can take years or even longer to make, such as Contradictory Conjunction, but is still possible if you are patient and uninterrupted in your work. You'll also find that you effortlessly master any sort of word-based supernatural power, possessing much more strength than any of your peers would with the same sorts of powers at your normal Level.
        Capstone Boosted: The next step of Styles is to take them from being original to converting other things into Styles. You're able to create new Styles by converting existing power and abilities you have into Styles, though this does not remove the original version of the power. The power will still require any energy or material costs as normal and possesses most of the same drawbacks but any sort of physical action required or time requirement is reduced to just a few words needing to be spoken by you. You could be able to cast any of your fire spells simply by saying Fire with different inflections and tones or unleash barrages of blasts of kinetic forces by reciting technique names from martial arts.


-Fantasy Seal (Touhou Forbidden Hermit) (600CP)
You have great aptitude when it comes to creating barriers, sealing, and undoing those seals yourself. What this means is that anything, no matter how strong, can be sealed away by you. Even when you encounter the supposedly “invulnerable” and “unsealable” you will always be able to find a hidden gap, a secret weakness, that makes them vulnerable to your sealing. Breaking seals can be a fiddly, fine process to do if you want to preserve whatever object was used as the sealing instrument, though if you don’t care about that you can always simply brute force it to instantly annihilate the seal. To be able to break any seal, no matter how powerful, is your “cheat skill”.


-Glyph Magic (Thief) (600CP)
        You've been trained in the secret art of glyph magic. By writing it down on a surface you can activate the magic. Eventually your skill might grow to the point where you can "draw" in the air. There are Battle Glyphs that are utilized in battle, such as attacking or for defensive purposes like invisibility. Utility Glyphs allow you to augment something, such as augmenting a statue with animation, or closing another glyph. Stationary Glyphs are permanent, they allow things like locking a door, or a chair to the ground, or perhaps even opening a secret door. These are just some of the possibilities that were presented in the games, but perhaps you will find creative uses for all these glyphs. Additionally you've been granted the secrets of the transformation glyphs used for Glyph Enhanced perk, allowing you to enhance those that serve under you.


-Magical Prodigy (Ben 10) (600CP)
        You're a wizard, Jumper You start out with enough knowledge to perform basic spells such as generating wind and track people and are generally on the same level as Charmcaster at the beginning of Ben 10. You're a magical prodigy that could one day reach the same level of power as Bezel himself if you pushed yourself hard enough, but that could take decades if not centuries of studying and practice.


Merlin Returned (Generic Harry Potter Fanfiction) (600CP)
        There were ancient tales of your coming, Jumper. Actually, wait, no. There weren't. But there should have been. You were born to greatness, and this reflects in everything you do. Magic is second nature to you. While you don't get any skill or knowledge innate with this perk, nor any gifts or talents that pass down bloodlines or through rituals, you now have limitless talent in every single branch of magic apart from these limitations. Besides that, you are a genius at learning magic too, mastering years' worth of material in days and weeks without even stressing yourself. This growth continues indefinitely, never slowing no matter what. Your grasp of magic and its theoretical framework is such that you can manipulate the very nature of it, and do so with an almost contemptuous ease. You can take apart spells, rituals or even entire magic systems, and put them back together in whatever different arrangement you like, even in entirely new magic systems of your own. Even altering spells in real time is second nature to you, changing their effects, size, scope, everything. As is coming up with entirely new pieces of magic, with due research and innovation.
        Finally, to fuel all this, your 'Magical Core', per se, is proportionately vast. You have a humongous amount of magic at your fingertips, stretching far and beyond any known metrics well into the realm of legends like Merlin and the Founders. This perk follows you in the future too, providing you all of these effects in any and all magic you become able to do. This perk is a capstone booster, meaning that it serves to enhance each of the origin capstones in their own ways. The interactions are mentioned alongside the respective perks.


-Meta Art Shenanigans (A 'Happy' Harry Potter Fanfiction) (600CP)
        When you were small and dipped your tiny little fingers into paint, the world opened up to you enrapturing your infant mind with the things you could create. Now older, you've put your heart and soul into refining that artistic talent to the point it became a bit...mad in the process, Jumper. You can manipulate 2D and flat 3D images in impossible ways like making non-magical paintings talk, turning a picture of running shoes into actual running shoes, and if you draw a T-Rex bursting out of the wall with chalk it can attack and drag people into the wall with it, and many more strange things besides. You also have a close connection with the things you draw as well as the 2D dimension and can interact with them in strange ways. Draw a dark tunnel with an exit at the end and you can walk through it like a portal, stick your hand to a flat wall and become a 2D cartoon painting that can move and travel through deep cracks to enter rooms, even create traps just by drawing them where people will step. You can do all this and more, Jumper, so long as you have the materials or viable surfaces, as your artistic talent could make Michelangelo weep if you put enough thought into it.


-Mystcraft (Minecraft) (600CP)
        With a bit of paper, leather, and ink, you can create Linking and Descriptive Books, which allow you to travel between worlds... within some limits. No Linking Book will be able to return you to any world but your current jump, so long as your chain continues. Furthermore, without a genuine understanding of the nature of dimensions, any new world you create with a Descriptive Book will be another Minecraft-type world, cursed to Decay into nothingness over the course of a week or so. This can be a handy way to gather resources without disrupting a 'real' world, or a good place to experiment with dangerous things, but nothing more... at least for now. Be sure to keep your Linking Books handy and your Descriptive Books safe; should you lose your Linking Book, you will be trapped within a doomed world, and should the Descriptive Book that defines a world be destroyed while you are in it, you will be destroyed alongside it. Careful searching of these worlds may turn up hints of forgotten lore that you can use to improve your skills, but the rotten fragments of paper you find in these decaying libraries will raise more questions than they answer.


-Real v Fake (Monogatari Series) (600CP)
        Truth, despite what you may have heard, is not a single, clear-cut and defined answer. It is malleable, changing to fit the definition of the one seeking it. Nowhere is this clearer than the debate on whether a fake thing can surpass the real thing or not. You have a certain ability based on what is real and what is fake, depending on which of the three options below you pick from. You may buy this perk multiple times, though each option is only discounted to Specialists.
        The first option is to believe that what is real will always trump what is not. You gain the ability to make any real thing automatically trump over any fake copies over that same real thing, such as making a genuine legendary sword always cut straight through any replicas made of that legendary sword, and that these real things will also possess a strong advantage against any fake thing in general, such as a genuinely made shield being much stronger against imaginary bullets or magical fire.
        The second option is to believe that there is no actual difference between a fake and the real thing. This allows you to treat good quality fake things as if they were actually the real thing, even if they don't match exactly. Those fake legendary swords, even if they are normally significantly weaker than the real deal, can instead become the real thing in full at your command.
        The final option is for you to believe that fake things can eventually surpass the real thing, if they earnestly try for such a thing. With this, you can force fake copies of things to slowly grow in power until they are twice as good as the original real thing and then improve further so long as they are constantly used. Those fake blades might not be as good as the real deal


-Reshaping (Geneforge) (600CP)
        Normally applying shaping magic to a living creature in some way other than an attempt at healing them will cause horrific and rather random results. Though much of shaping was developed by doing this, and carefully studying the results, truly modifying a living being to a great degree is impossible to control without carefully crafted essence, or incredibly complicated equipment such as the geneforge itself. You however have an innate ability to understand what you are doing and control the results.


-Restriction/Formation Expert | Cultivation | Formation and Restriction Flags (Renegade Immortal) (600CP)
        Restriction/Formation Expert (300CP)
        Formations and restrictions are two different yet similar methods of achieving similar results.
        Formations are ordered structures built from materials and powerful resources that can accomplish a variety of tasks, including teleportation across vast distances to pre-set destinations, creating incredibly powerful barriers to keep enemies out or allowing multiple weaker people to work together to create a far more powerful force. One of the most potent examples of formations, one that only late Second Step and Third Step cultivators would know about, is the Realm Sealing Formation, an unimaginably vast sealing formation that separates the Cave World into the Inner and Outer Realms.
        Restrictions, on the other hand, require no resources aside from knowledge and the divine sense and they can change according to the will of the user, making them much more dynamic and free-form as compared to formations. The most common use for restrictions is to boobytrap an area, filling a space with manifold restrictions that require long periods of careful study to bypass, lest you step on a blade of grass that will become a storm of blades that simultaneously sets off all the adjacent restrictions and creates a truly dangerous predicament. You have an incredible talent for your chosen discipline, as well as years of experience and a well honed sense of intuition for unknown restrictions or formations. This talent and experience has manifested in a particularly piercing gaze, allowing you see through restrictions, formations and patterns with incredible ease.
        Cultivation (0CP)
        This represents your ability to cultivate, be it your body, your soul, your spirit or stranger things. Whatever the path, you have an average talent with all of them, representing a span of physical potential, mental ability and potency of self. Your willpower is bolstered, enough that the pains and hardships everyone must face are bearable. Focusing on one thing or another for long periods of time is now easy.
        Drop-ins start at the first stage of Qi Condensation, but have no method or techniques they didn't buy here. Mortals have no cultivation and thus no method or technique, but still retain the same level of talent as the others, barring any other purchases. Young Cultivators have a method of average value, a small handful of middling techniques and a cultivation mid-way through Qi Condensation. Old Cultivators have a cultivation of early Foundation Establishment, a potent method and a collection of techniques that would make any junior envious.
        You aren't restricted in the heights your cultivation can reach, but with just this it's unlikely you'll make it far with just this.
        Once you leave this jump you will be able to give other people the ability to cultivate.
        Formation and Restriction Flags (300CP)
        This is a set of formation or restriction flags, created from a great deal of resources, that allow you to easily set up formations, or employ restrictions, on the fly. For 100 CP you receive a set of nine basic formation or restriction flags.
        The set of formation flags each have one fairly basic formation that can be set up on any location in moments, and removed just as easily. They contain basic formations such as ones that can gather enough spiritual energy from the surroundings to greatly aid the cultivation of even a Foundation Establishment cultivator, seal areas so that even peak Foundation Establishment cultivators have to go to great lengths to break into them, or link the energies of a set of people inside a certain area so that each of them is as strong as all of them put together, up to the peak of the great circle of Foundation Establishment.
        The set of restriction flags contains flags of the same strength except that these contain one restriction each. They contain basic restrictions such as ones that can launch attacks when unauthorized people trespass on certain places, restrictions that can trap locations, doors, chests or items and trigger preset effects when they are interacted with in certain manners, or even restrictions that act like spells and abilities of significant strength and can be used actively in combat.
        You can obtain either set for 100 CP and both for 200 CP. Formation Experts receive a basic set of Formation Flags for free and Restriction Experts receive a basic set of restriction flags for free. And both of them can modify and even replace the formations and restrictions in the flags.
        For an undiscounted 100 CP you can upgrade all your sets of flags. Upgraded sets have flags that can hold multiple formations or restrictions, up to nine each. The upgraded flags can hold restrictions of any level of strength and the formations or restrictions they hold to start with have increased in strength to the Core Formation level.
        * Cultivation is needed to make use for formations/restrictions


-Ritualist (Ravenwood) (600CP)
        Ritual magic is an extensive form of arcane practice that allows those using it to accomplish great works even as fairly weak mages. You have gained considerable knowledge, both practical and theoretical, on the workings of ritual magic and, by extension, sacrificial blood magic. This allows you to create far reaching and incredibly powerful spell matrices that can be supplied over time by anyone, or fuelled by the life force of sacrificed creatures or blood. Such spell matrices last much longer than common spells, able to persist for weeks on a single casting. Additionally, each casting can be built up over time, allowing it to be stretched out in small portions that, if interrupted, can be restarted without losing all the progress made on the ritual. Even fast rituals, using sacrifices of life force (from yourself or a suitable sacrifice), can be quite persistent, lasting hours where a similar spell would only survive minutes. This is extensively used by the races of the demiplane to create Rituals of Propagation, complex rituals that can be used to turn humanoids into another race, designated by the ritual design. An individual may undergo multiple such rituals, but may become unstable, either physically or mentally, if too many are done without enough recovery time between such uses, which can take several years. You and your companions will automatically recover at the start of each new jump.


-Scientific Magic (Touhou Forbidden Hermit) (600CP)
Magicians in Gensokyo are similar to scientists in the outside world. Magic is conducted through trial and error, when one magician makes a breakthrough others find it relatively easy to copy it. This includes you; for you can easily find ways to duplicate any spell you know exists, even translating it from different magic systems into ones you know. This includes magic to extend your life indefinitely, and indeed is part of why in recent years mages have achieved immortality younger than ever before.


-Soul Study (The Weakness Of Beatrice) (600CP)
        The core of existence, at least for natural life forms. You've put countless long hours into studying that soul that lies at the centre of your being and the souls of other people as well. Slowly, you mastered this art, gaining the knowledge of how to interact with and manipulate the soul itself. You know how to physically interact with and move souls from one vessel to another, to create souls from nothing, to give physical form for souls to inhabit, to directly alter and change the soul itself and even how to bring back souls of those who have very recently passed on, saving them from death. To many, what you do is both a miracle and blasphemy, both of the highest order. To you though, it's just another science.


-Spellmaker (Morroblivion) (600CP)
        You are talented at creating new spells from trial and error. They tend to be relatively efficient in terms of magicka expenditure and can incorporate various effects. Creating new effects is time consuming but possible.


-Talisman Master (Talisman Emperor - Mortal Dimension) (600CP)
        While most mortals' exposure to talismans is the small, charm-like items that allow limited use of martial techniques, the Dao of Talismans is a Grand Dao which is the pinnacle of organizing and using other Daos and energy. Purchasing this perk provides you with the benefits of every specialty listed under Master Craftsman, a similar level of knowledge on the creation of the aforementioned minor talismans, mastery of the Dao Insight for Talismans, and the ability to use that Dao to control the power of all of your other Dao Insights to maximize their potential
        Master Craftsman: alchemy/pill refining, equipment refinement, formations, puppets, spirit chef
        * In this world Talismans lead to the peak of cultivation.


-Lesser Magicks (Lone Wolf) (700CP)
        These are the beginning magicks of the Shianti. Shianti Origin who select this ability can choose four skills off of this list after paying the cost of the perk. Non Shianti Origin can choose three after paying the cost. Additional skills are 100CP per skill beyond the number allotted by your Origin. Using the Moonstone will enhance the strength and utility of spells from these disciplines.
        Sorcery (100CP)
        This power allows a wizard to transform his thoughts and desires into magical energy. Focusing your energies will allow you to create magical shields or move objects.
        Enchantment (100CP)
        Enchantment enables a wizard to charm or beguile other creatures, and create illusions in the minds of others.
        Elementalism (100CP)
        Minor control over the natural elements of Air, Fire, Earth, and Water. Using this ability requires a trance state. Also, spirits of the Elemental Plane may not understand your request and might answer your call for aid in the manner you did not intend.
        Alchemy (100CP)
        The ability to create potions and solutions to effect objects and individuals.
        Prophecy (100CP)
        Through the use of a meditative state, a wizard can foretell the future. The clarity of the foretelling is tied to the wizard's knowledge of the object or individual in question. Asking about someone or something you know will give more detail than someone or something unknown.
        Psychomancy (100CP)
        The ability to see and read the past by laying hands on an object. Results may be cryptic, and magic can be used to create intentionally misleading results.
        Evocation (100CP)
        The ability to contact the spirit realm and speak with the dead. Spirits communed with may be hostile, requiring the wizard to ward himself, and spirits will require the wizard to perform a task in exchange for any aid rendered. Failing to accomplish the agreed upon task may result in the wizard losing his life.


-Maker of Magic (The Weakness Of Beatrice) (800CP)
        The Sage began by learning how to Mix physical things. Then she moved onto magical things. Then she moved onto the soul itself. All of her great works paled in comparison to what she mastered and gave to the world when she first appeared to the public though. Manipulation of the Magic System itself. She turned a traditional system of magic into one like what you'd see in an MMO videogame, changing this magic over two whole worlds. Now that knowledge and ability is yours. You have the ability and knowledge to make widespread changes and alterations to magical systems with a few hours of focus and work. You could make a system based on ritual invocations and sacrifices take on the form of an RPG magic system or vice versa. You can combine systems you already have access to with new ones in however ways you like, add restrictions or even remove limitations and add new aspects, though improving the overall power would require comboing with a stronger magic system you already know. The changes you make are applied to the entirety of the subject Magic System but beings with more power than you are not required to use it, instead being able to rely on the old system if they wish. Those weaker than you are forced to follow all the new rules, unless they themselves can prevent it somehow.


-Wizard | Soul Source (Dresden Files) (800CP)
Wizard (200CP)
        You're a full-fledged member of the White Council, with all the rights, privileges, and obligations that entails. A lot of times that's more hassle than it's worth, especially with a war on, but there's a lot of resources you can call on when you need to, as long as you're prepared to repay the favor when need be. What this background really gets you is the full training a wizarding background offers, which has left you able to call on the entire array of everything magic is capable of. And, with enough time and preparation, there's very little which doesn't fit within that category. One quick word of warning before taking this background. Once you go Practitioner, you're bound by the Laws of Magic. There's only seven of them, set out by the White Council to prevent the worst corruptions magic poses, and they're there for a good reason. Violating one of the laws isn't just an awful thing to do, it's true black magic - the kind that stains your soul, permanently changing you into the sort of person who does break that law. It's addictive, and the more you break the law the easier it'll be, until you wind up in "When all you have is a hammer" scenario. Because of that, there's generally only one sentence for violation: death by decapitation.
        1) Thou Shalt Not Kill. Or, at least, not with magic. There's a reason Wardens run around with silver swords, and wizards like to carry handguns as backup. There's a couple of exceptions, mainly centered around clear self defense, but if your magic ends up taking someone out permanently, even completely by accident, you've broken this law.
        2) Thou Shalt Not Change Another. In other words, no turning people into newts. There's a bit of a gray area when it comes to transforming yourself, though if you're not a natural talent at it I'd strongly recommend against it, because unless you're Senior Counsel material this sort of magic always ends badly for the target.
        3) Thou Shalt Not Invade the Mind of Another. Pretty simple - other people's heads are inviolate, so stay out. The Soulgaze is an exception here, since it's not about looking into the mind but the soul, which is a vastly different experience.
        4) Thou Shalt Not Enthrall Another. This one can be a bit tricky; technically, this only refers to uses of magic to directly alter someone's natural inclinations, choices, and behaviors. Threatening to set someone on fire doesn't count, nor does locking them in a magic circle until they agree to your demands, nor catching someone in a Faerie contract. But any time you're stepping into their head and making changes to your liking, you're running afoul of this one.
        5) Thou Shalt Not Reach Beyond the Borders of Life. This covers anything related to the subject of necromancy - raising the dead, animating corpses, or even keeping someone from dying when they've suffered a mortal wound. Of course, potential Ectomancers shouldn't be deterred by this; ghosts are just echoes, and magic dealing with them falls well on the right side of the line.
        6) Thou Shalt Not Swim Against the Currents of Time. There's not a lot to go on here, because if someone was violating this law, how would we even know about it? It might not even be possible, and this might just be a warning that bad things happen if you try. Still, best to be safe and just leave the time travel to the guys with screwdrivers instead of wands.
        7) Thou Shalt Not Open the Outer Gates. You might want to take note of this one, because it's a doozy. This is the only one of the laws that deals with mere knowledge rather than action; you do not research the Outsiders, you do not contact them, you do not ask them for power, you do not go on multiversal road trips for their amusement. Yeah, you're already way afoul of this one, but I won't tell if you won't. Just don't do it here, because the "local" Outsiders are Bad News with capital letters.
        Now, these rules only apply to mortal practitioners, which means if you're something else you don't really have to worry about it. Of course, that cuts both ways; technically, none of the laws (except Law Seven) apply to anything which isn't human. Burn one of the Black Court to ash with a fireball, raise a zombie T-Rex, and you're still on the right side of the laws, although the Warden who investigates might disagree.
        They also only apply to magic as the White Council knows it, which means anything you drag in from elsewhere technically isn't a violation of the first six laws, and won't stain your soul the same way. Of course, they're not going to know the difference, and if they did, it's a violation of the Seventh, so don't go arguing about it.
        Soul Source (600CP)
        Somehow, you've gained the power of Soulfire; the ability to use the energies of your soul to enhance your magic. By infusing a spell with notjust your will, but all your being, it'll be infused with a sort of "mystic rebar," granting it a lot of strength and giving it significantly more structure. Since your self is part of the spell now, it also functions more along the lines of your intentions, rather than just providing you with a raw boost. Of course, this comes at a cost: you're literally burning away part of your soul for power. Souls do heal up, especially when engaged in "soul-affirming" activities, but overuse might be worse than fatal.


-Feel It Out | Synchronicity Event (F.E.A.R.) (900CP)
        Feel It Out (600CP)
        Your ability to understand machines and designs are more than just knowledge, and anyone who follows your work would know this well. You have a subtle psionic ability to 'understand' the machines and items that you physically touch, to the point where you can understand how it might work. More importantly, what you could do to also make it better. Naturally the more complex or esoteric the item is, the more drastically the time needed increases. But the more information you collect the more ideas and methods you can formulate to begin working.
        Synchronicity Event (300CP)
        [Requires "Feel It Out"] Curiouser and curiouser. Due to coming into contact with... well, SOMETHING, your psionic abilities have noticeably increased. Psychic powers you may have had are stronger now, with control and development coming more quickly with practice. There is also a boon to this; by taking a few days to 'attune' a person, you may impart upon them the beginning of psionic abilities of their own. You may only gift one school at a time, and they start at the very beginning; if they are to grow and learn as you have, it would be wise to teach them. On the plus side, they'll eventually become as strong as you are, so you'll have quite the pupil on your hands.


-Technomagical Genius | All Magic Affinity (In Another World With My Smartphone) (1000CP)
        Technomagical Genius (600CP)
        You are a master of both magic and technology, as well as fusing them together. Your only equal in the history of the world would be the famous Regina Babylon, the genius professor that created the flying islands of Babylon (named after herself) as well as the Frame Gears ... which are basically magi-technical giant mecha. You are her equal in these arts and crafts in every regard, your only limitation being access to resources and personal magical ability if you don't have All Magic Affinity. You can even make gynoids and transfer the consciousness of a person into said gynoid if you felt like it.
        All Magic Affinity (400CP)
        Like what it implies, you have an Affinity with all types of magic, including all types of Null magic. This means that you have the (possibly unique) ability to use all types of magic in the world, needing only to know the chant needed to activate it and a general idea of what the magic is supposed to do. For example by knowing that the Gate spell requires the chant of gate and that it is a spell that opens a portal to a place you have already been you would be capable of casting that spell. You carry this ability to quickly learn and master all forms of magic to future worlds and systems.
Leaving that aside your magic is tremendously potent and you have a monstrous amount of magical energy, enough that you could chain cast extremely powerful spells affecting incredible numbers of people without even noticing fatigue, much less actually suffering from such. In fact unless and until someone tells you that magical fatigue is supposed to be a thing after casting a lot of magic you probably won't even realize there's supposed to be a limit on how much magic a person can use.


-Facets of Sockets | Chromafactor (Gemcraft Frostborn Wrath) (1200CP)
        Facets of Sockets (600CP)
        Gems are both a way of effecting the world and a stable source of power, but they don't actually do anything unless directed. Sockets are the mounting points for gems, and they define how the gem's power is expressed in the world. They don't provide any power, but they provide a path for existing power to flow along in order to achieve specific results. This perk makes you an expert at the types of sockets in the gemcraft world, and also allows you to come up with novel designs in the future. All gemcrafters know how to create Towers, Gem-Traps, Lanterns, Amplifiers, and Pylons, but you can make more efficient versions of them that syphon off some of a gem's spare power to reinforce themselves. Oh, and we'll even toss in Magical Walls for free. Be aware that these structures are made of solidified mana and thus the more of them you have linked to your Orb of Presence (or around your personal fortress) the more building a new one will cost.
        Chromafactor (600CP)
        Different wizards use different colors of gems to enact different effects. This perk allows you to create new gem colors based on any magic that you understand at a fundamental level. The gems can then be used as inflexible but incredibly potent foci for those effects. If a normal sleep spell could cause a strong foe to become drowsy, the applications of a gem that can send entire armies into eternal slumber are hopefully obvious. This also acts as a capstone booster, providing additional benefits from each origin's capstone perk




  --- Domain: Crafting: Artisan (26) (37 Perks) --- 




-Beniemiya (Fate/Legends Japan Land of the Rising Sun) (50CP)
        It might just be something in the water, both what you're drinking and what you serve to the guests that adore every meal you make. You're a savant when it comes to making meals, not just limited to Eastern dishes either. With a little experimentation, you can make almost anything into a mouth watering feast for both the taste buds and the eyes. The real problem isn't making a good meal but keeping all these greedy pigs from eating you out of house and home. Don't even try making hamburgers around any blonde ladies, it never ends well. Now, while cooking good food is a prize well worth it, you do also have a more useful aspect here. By channeling magical energy into your tools and ingredients as you work, you're able to 'enchant' the meal with a variety of useful effects. A hearty beef stew that lets a warrior heal their wounds much faster than normal, sugary sweets that give people the speed of the wind, a mighty hamburger that temporarily bulges the muscles to greater heights. Even negative effects are possible, if you want to taint your food that way. They only last for a temporary period and the effects tend to be fairly weak without a lot of mana put in but it makes your food all the more popular.


-Artisan (Generic Builder) (100CP)
        You have a talent for creating works of art. Creation times are halved and your natural talent increases with each purchase of this knack. Your artwork has an almost magical ability to invoke a particular emotion that you set at the time of its creation, scary masks, awe inspiring fountains, creepy puppets or such. The degree of emotion-induction effect increases with skill.
        * Can be taken indefinitely for creation time modifiers


-Craftsman (Generic Builder) (100CP)
        You have a talent for creating things requiring wood as well as selecting the best wood for the job at hand. Creation times are halved for each purchase of this knack and the results are always visually impressive if you so wish.
        * Can be taken indefinitely for creation time modifiers


-Lunatic Trickster (Van Helsing) (100CP)
        You will have peasantry frequently knocking at your door with their torches and pitchforks, adventurers dashing through your laboratories, and your creations frequently trying to escape. Now you can prevent all of this from happening with your knowledge of creating fiendish, murderous traps of all damage ranges & variants! Those not entirely dependent on the environment, such as pitfall traps, can be stored in small silver discs to be used as weapons.


-Shaper (Age Of Wonders II) (100CP)
        Stone is a tough servant, resisting most ways to work it by unskilled hands. Under your touch, however, it molds itself eagerly, as if it were unable to wait to become the new shapes you wish for it. You are a gifted artisan with the natural materials of the world, and can build fortifications, buildings, and other creations out of wood, stone, sand, and any other such materials with great ease. Indeed, under your touch the materials you work with seem to become greater, somehow - sand and clay toughen to match granite when building a wall, and a carved wooden blade seems to hold its edge like fine steel once you're finished with it.


-Architectural Madness (Exalted - The Infernal) (200CP)
        Malfean architecture is unlike anything found in Creation, with endless variety and many oddities. Many techniques that were once burned away by She Who Lives in Her Name have been rediscovered. Foremost in these are the techniques to allow demons to build structures that do not need pillars, arches and other support structures. Buildings hundreds if not thousands of feet high can be built without any apparent load-bearing walls or struts. Windows and doors can be placed anywhere without disrupting the integrity of a building.
        Of course these techniques work best with the brass and black stone common to Malfeas, even if they work to a lesser extent with other materials. So it is just one more reason most buildings in Malfeas are made of brass and basalt, along with their abundant presence. Yet many more techniques are used by the artisans and architects of Malfeas, even aside from the omnipresent murals, wall carvings, and other ornamentations.
        Techniques to create such marvels as buildings that sprout from the ground at unnatural angles and made of polished brass turned a rainbow of colors by a process known only to the most skilled of architects. In many of these techniques you have gained the pinnacle of skill and knowledge, that you might replicate the Demon City's constructions even in other realms. While you might not have reliable access to the materials common to those in hell, you will be able to substitute many other materials for these in your structures. And as a truly talented architect you will find the design and construction of Manses comes just as easily to you, even gleaning some additional power from the conflux of essence it is build upon if you do use these hellish methods.


-Deku Crafting (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - SB) (200CP)
        The Deku are a simple race, but they can still make some fancy items, and now you can too. From well-crafted wooden items, to a large leafy-fan that can manipulate the winds, to a special Deku Copter that can allow for flight, anything made by the Deku can be made by you as well. As a bonus, this skill also translates to an improved skill in shaping trees into houses or other structures, if you so desire.


-Gerudo Crafting (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - SB) (200CP)
        You are a Gerudo Craftswoman, with all the skill that implies. You can make clothing for both voe and vai that can keep them cool and even help protect from lightning, fashion gorgeous swords and shields designed to be used by the greatest warriors, and Shock Arrows that encapsulate the fury of the storm itself, releasing a mighty shockwave on impact. Any item made by Gerudo hands can be shaped by yours, so long as you have gathered all needed ingredients.


-If You Want It Done Right (Lords Of The Night-Liches) (200CP)
        There's people who leech off of other people's efforts. Herd animals, herbivores, the kind of weaklings who fall in line. You aren't one of them. You know the only person whose work you can really trust. A big project can be hard to tackle by yourself. Different resources, different specialities. Even if you know all the different pieces, you might not know how to put all of them together. Even if you know how to put them together, changing tracks and approaches all the time can scuttle your work. There are many extra problems that arise when you go alone, and many problems that are solved simply by having a second pair of hands helping you. None of that applies to you. Unless a problem literally requires a second pair of hands or other such gross physical assets, the work doesn't grow harder for you, simply because you have to do it all yourself. This doesn't make it easier either - if a project requires a thousand man hours of work, then you'll need to put that in. But the lack of help won't make it worse or harder. You can simply do things by yourself, provided you put in the work and the time. And for a lich, whom has all the time in the world? Well, nothing more needs to be said, does it?


-Rito Crafting (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - SB) (200CP)
        You have the ability of a Rito Craftsman. You are able to craft warm clothing that can help keep out the chill, even when soaring at the highest heights, powerful bows that can be used to fire multiple arrows at once, Fire Arrows which are enhanced with mighty winds to fan their flames hotter and create mightier updrafts, and more. Anything that has been built by a Rito can be recreated by you, given the right resources.


-Shopping list (The Weakness Of Beatrice) (200CP)
        Mixing for years and years, constantly keeping on the lookout for the next big ingredient to make something really impressive and attention gathering, you've memorised countless recipes already. In fact, you seem to even remember some recipes you're sure you never studied before. Just seeing something is enough for you to understand its recipe. You know the component pieces of whatever you're looking at, though you may not necessarily understand or know what those component pieces are, you will know what the components have as components and so on. You're also aware of what any of the component pieces you have seen can be combined to make, meaning that seeing more things will not only tell you how those things are made but also how to make even more things on top.


-Crafting Genius (Final Fantasy XI) (300CP)
        You are adept with using the synthesis system to create any items or consumables which adventurers use on a regular basis, such as armor and potions. To a lesser extent, this also makes you a jack of all trades when it comes to mundane means of crafting similar items. Your work tends to be of high quality relative to the rest of the setting.


-Craftsman (Renegade Immortal) (300CP)
        Building and crafting things is an omnipresent facet of civilization. Utensils, furniture, homes and everything else, they all need people to build them. It's the same for cultivators, though the sheer length of time they live tends to mean that everyone picks up some skills here and there. When they actually devote time and effort towards mastering crafting though? The results are beyond belief.
        For 100CP, you have the talent and skill of a mortal master in an area of your choosing, such as smithing, carving, painting, sculpting or similar things. The things you can create with this skill are beautiful and functional enough to draw admiration from mortal emperors and kings. Mortals receive a free purchase of this perk.
        For 200CP, you have transcended the realm of mortal talent in all areas of craft and can sculpt statues so accurate to the real thing that they possess a shadow of the aura produced by the real thing and paintings so evocative that they can drive a man to tears or uplift him for the rest of his life. Beautiful weapons that never dull and do far more damage than they should and treasures that would be the envy of any lower realm cultivator. Mortals can buy this level for 100CP.
        For 300CP, you have the sheer level of talent and vision necessary to match, and eventually outclass Esteemed Tian Bao, the most famed craftsman of the collapsed Celestial Realm from ages gone by who was responsible for the God Slaying Chariot, an attempt to create a peerless weapon that was surprisingly successful in the end. While you're not there yet, with time, experimentation and the right materials, you could create similarly powerful treasures, artifacts or pieces of art, things that would attract the attention of Third Step cultivators. Mortals can buy this level for 200CP.


-Savant  | Wonder Forging Genius (Generic Exalted) (300CP)
Savant (100CP)
        You're a Savant! This means you've got an incredible insight in crafting all sorts of things, from meals, to clothes, to armor, to weapons, to magical devices, and all sorts of other things besides. Even if you've never done something before so long as it's a skill remotely 'craft like' in nature you'll be able to perform it at the level of a (mortal) master. This just represents innate talent, and if you actually focus on developing such skills the normal way you'll quickly outstrip even the best that a mortal craftsman could accomplish, able to make artwork that speaks to the soul (perhaps literally) or armor and weapons of surpassing quality that look like show-room pieces despite being suitable for combat and also being sturdy and reliable to a frankly unbelievable degree. Purchasing this will even make you substantially better than other Exalted craftsmen, assuming you put in the same amount of effort that they did.
Wonder Forging Genius (200CP)
        Your crafting abilities need to be seen to be believed. From your hands pour forth miracles given form, works of art of peerless and breathtaking magnificence, works of culinary delight that would leave Emperors sullen at the thought that no other foods could compare, weapons that could last hundreds of years of constant use that would leave men feeling honored to have been slain by them, all these and more take shape under the guidance of your hands. You would be welcomed in any land and by any court for the sheer quality of your work, and you will quickly gain national, if not worldwide, fame for your creations if you bother to advertise them at all.
        The least of your creations are superior to anything a mortal master might create, and even the simplest and least adorned of your works will be possessed of unmatched efficiency, resilience, and simple elegance.
        Purchased with the Savant perk this is taken to an even grander height, leaving even the crafts of other Exalted looking as pale and shameful imitations by comparison, assuming you put forth the same effort they did in learning your base crafting abilities.


-Soft Physics (Generic Builder) (300CP)
        You have a touch of madness in your soul, your creations often make physics cry. Or maybe you're some sort of comic book style super-genius, with a device or invention for seemingly every occasion? Regardless, the things you make have a lot more leeway in just what they can do, thanks to not necessarily needing to obey silly things like 'physical laws', 'thermodynamics', or similar. As with all Builder related powers just how far you can stretch this depends mostly on how skilled you are and how long you've been developing your abilities.


-Workshop Artisan (Bloodborne) (300CP)
        As if taught at the long gone workshop, you seem to possess knowledge and skill with many of their crafting techniques. You have been granted the knowledge and skills needed to both repair and even create your own Trick Weapons and Hunter's Tools.
        Trick Weapons are weapons with a variety of special abilities relating to their form. The most common type of Trick Weapons are those that can transform in some manner. An example being swords that can lock into specialized sheaths in order to become different weapons, sometimes radically so. Not to say transformation is the only ability, there are also melee weapons with guns attached, and maces that can be charged with unnatural blue electricity to deal massive damage.
        Hunter's Tools are pieces of equipment with special abilities activated by using Blood Bullets or Quicksilver Bullets as a medium. Hunter's Tools are usually supernatural items that have been made to work using a Blood/Quicksilver Bullet medium, such as the Beast Roar, a beast's claw that when activated, allows the wielder to roar like a beast.
        Some Hunter's Tools are completely man made as well, though this is a relative minority. Basically, you now know how to convert things into being activated and powered by Blood Bullets and Quicksilver Bullets. Doing so allows anyone to use them, even if they are completely mundane beings, so long as they have the bullets mentioned above on their person. When making Hunter's Tools, remember that the more power something requires, the bullets the wielder will need. These skills granted to you may be honed over time, just as any other skill can.


-Core Tuning (MOUSEHUNT) (400CP)
        When hunters were focused on tackling the mouse problem around Gnawnia, there wasn't much of a need for trap variety. The mice around Gnawnia are simple critters, and even a simple mallet trap would work against them. But then the problem was suppressed, and hunters began moving to different regions. This led to them encountering mice for which the traditional mousetrap was utterly ineffective, marking the beginning of an arms race with no apparent end.
        Whether you're working on a project for a friend or for personal use, this allows you to modify a very specific property, the power type. Seen as an elemental affinity of sorts, this property is key to making tools effective under a wide range of circumstances. The traditional Physical trap doesn't do all that well against ghostly entities, but Shadow traps tend to work well. Arcane traps excel against magical entities, but certain mice are too strategically minded that they specifically require Tactical traps in order to be bested.
        There are nine different power types which can be cycled through. Physical, Tactical, Shadow, Arcane, Hydro, Forgotten, Draconic, Parental, Law and Rift. Most of these are rather straightforward except for the extremely esoteric ones like Forgotten (intended for eldritch entities...like the Old One Mice), Law (intended for criminals and outlaws) and Parental (intended for effectively anything that isn't an adult). It's important to note that this modification is more akin to an addition rather than a replacement. Existing elemental affinities on the target item are unaffected by this. You could take what is potentially a Physical Trap and give it Arcane properties.


-Fairy Talent: Art (Peter Pan) (400CP)
You are constantly inspired to produce various works of art, but your greatest strength lies in painting. For you, painting is not merely a physical skill, but a magical one, as you can literally determine the color of things by painting them. Any change you make to a target’s color becomes its true, permanent color unless you use a new paint. The colors will also enhance certain traits and strengths of the subject depending on the symbolism; for instance, blue embodies depth and stability, while orange represents joy and excitement. And if the colors should belong on something else, it can become that thing; for instance, painting stripes on a horse makes it a zebra, and painting a dome brown or white could turn it into an earthy hill or an igloo respectively. This ability also allows you to change the seasons by painting leaves either green or orange; once you paint enough of them the same color, the world will conclude that it must be time for that season and change accordingly.


-Heavenly Artificer Understanding (Exalted - The Sidereals) (400CP)
        The archives of Heaven still record the hidden lore of the First Age, which once raised magitech cities across Creation. You have studied all these under the tutelage of maker-gods of each mortal craft. This has made you a master of creating everything from swords to bridges to liquors to poems. You will also experience certain inspirations, strange moods that will guide you to make some specific object. If you do create it, you will eventually find yourself in a situation where it was exactly what you needed.


-Mythic (Irish Mythology) (400CP)
        Whether you call them gods or fairies, the Children of Danu are just so much more, in many ways. They drink more, eat more, laugh more, love more. This perk brings a similar sense of epicness to your life, improving to at least some degree all other perks as you fight harder, sing better, see deeper and craft better items.
        More, it adds some more... abstract qualities. An ordinary warrior cannot batter a howling storm into submission, or punch someone so hard cows give virgin birth hundreds of miles away. But with this perk, you can. A humble smith cannot make a bow from the rainbow or catch a maiden's sigh and sharpen it to literally cut to a man's heart. With this, you can. It's a new and altogether more legendary way of seeing and interacting with the world.


-The Legendary God-forging Craftsman (Against The Gods!) (400CP)
        There are a lot of things in this world that go beyond martial cultivation and powering up. Sound Transmission Talismans, Profound Arks, armors and weapons, medicinal pills and teleportation formations, and so much more. And you can shake the world in all these fields. You are now an absolute, unbelievable genius at all such 'support' fields. An enchanter, smith, alchemist and formation designer without peer, your mind miles ahead of even the greatest of your would-be competitors, and ideas flow like water. You only need to look at any item, pill, weapon or formation, to know it to the innermost depths, every trick involved in making it, every flaw and potential for improvement, and how to bring them to reality. In future worlds too, your skills translate perfectly, granting you knowledge and skills in the local variations of these things equal to what you leave the previous world with.


-Anartist (SCP Foundation) (600CP)
        No, not, "an artist," an anartist, or, "anomalous artist," is someone that, through a variety of means, can create anomalies, typically as a form of artistic expression. Music, sculpture, painting, these and more are ways to create anomalous objects, including sentient or even sapient objects. You need not be an artist to be an anartist; you could simply be someone like Doctor Wondertainment who makes anomalous objects. Speaking practically, you're only able to make Safe- or Euclid-class objects, however, and all objects are likely to have some form of side-effect; the stronger the object, the more likely it is for that side-effect to be potentially deleterious, unless extreme care and counter-measures are taken, especially if it's very quickly put together. Expect objects that are completely clear of side-effects to take around ten times as long as normal to complete, compared to things that have a normal, if somewhat cumbersome, side-effect. It's assumed that most people that make incredibly powerful anomalies die in the process, at some point. These anomalies can take any form, though it's best if their form follows their function.


-Create the Heavens and the Earth (The Magician - TV show) (600CP)
        You are a creator first and foremost. While most Deities simply reside over creations, you create them and more. With this perk your ability to "create" is massively boosted, and when it comes to creating things your accuracy in doing so, being through divine powers or through mundane practice, is astounding to say the least.
        Regardless of your Origin, you gain the ability to create any object, mundane or Magical, if you're normally able to create Magical items or enchant the things you're trying to make without this ability that is, that's the size of or smaller than the average Human, assuming you're willing to foot the cost in the Magical energy it would take to make the base mundane item and fuel the enchantments needed.
        This perk cannot reproduce things that require other esoteric methods of payment in the enchanting or creation process of a Magic item, such as the expenditure of experience, the usage of souls, or the power of love.
        This process can take anywhere from milliseconds to around ten seconds depending on the size of it and how Magical it is. Any existing abilities that allow you to create things are significantly boosted in potency, and anytime you bequeath any of your internal energies in some way to another it is incredibly boosted in potency, to the point where if you were a Deity and you gave someone a part of yourself to consume for temporary power, you could decide for it to instead boost them to near Deity levels for a short duration instead of the average Master Magician boost people normally get from such an action.


-Exalted Ways Dominance (Generic Exalted) (600CP)
        As one of the Dragon-blooded you were trained from birth to excel in the areas in which you showed talent, and you showed a great many talents indeed. Choose any seven of the following - War, Melee, Martial Arts, Archery, Thrown, Riding, Sailing, Socializing, Athletics, Awareness, Dodge, Bureaucracy, Crafting, Integrity, Investigation, Larceny, Linguistics, Lore, Medicine, Occult, Performance, Presence, Stealth, Survival, or Resistance. You are now the undisputed master of those seven skills. This is in addition to any skills or abilities you would normally be good at on account of your Caste or 'favored' choices.
        You can do things with the seven skills you have chosen while half drunk and blind on your worst day that the greatest mortal practitioners would never be able to replicate, even on their best day, in their entire lives. Additionally you can train anyone that you personally tutor in these seven abilities and they will quickly reach a level of skill close to, but just short of, your own level of skill. They will learn at a rate equivalent to an Exalt so long as you personally teach them, even if they aren't an Exalt.
        If you chose Dodge you might one day be able to walk through a rainstorm without getting wet. If you choose Archery you might strike a man's heart from over the horizon while he is standing in the middle of a forest. If you chose Bureaucracy the sheer efficiency and speed with which your organization operates will baffle even the most astute observers and leave competitors hopelessly scrambling to catch up. Choosing Medicine might allow you to perform brain surgery with a rusty knife using only one hand, and have the patient come out the other side perfectly healthy. Point blank the things you can manage with your chosen skills would be outright impossible for nearly anyone else to replicate, even other Essence users needing to 'cheat' and use Charms in order to match what you can do with nothing but your own innate talent. You may purchase this perk up to three times, each time it is purchased you must select different abilities.


-Forging The Spear of Destiny (Duel Monsters - Duel Terminal Part 1) (600CP)
        To strike down evil, one must wield the appropriate weapon. It is for that cause, of aiding not only your fellows but the next generation who will live long past your own end, that you have taken the blacksmithing techniques of the Dragunity clan to a new level. Forging innately magical weapons, capable of summoning minor firestorms or striking with flensing wind, is simplicity itself for you. But where you truly shine is in the forging of power itself. Rendering a bolt of lightning into a spear, quenching shaped magical energy until it is a fine rapier, or even extracting the necrotic energies within an undead and refining it into an arrowhead, are all possible with some work. However, you are not limited to such easily visible forms of power. Should they cooperate, or prove incapable of resisting, you may forge a person's very power into a magical item reflecting their nature and capabilities. Perhaps even pool the power of multiple persons into a single weapon even greater than them although, it's not an idea you've had the chance to test, sadly. Parting with one's power forevermore is something not many can seriously consider.


-Incredibly Craftsmanship (Akame ga Kill) (600CP)
        While the method of creating Teigu is long lost you are able to create things almost at their level, with some research and a couple other skilled people you might even be able to recreate the lost arts that created the Teigu long ago. You also have all the skills to repair Teigu or other incredible items from near destruction.


-Magma Blacksmith (Duel Monsters - Duel Terminal Part 2) (600CP)
        Breaking the enemy in half with your bare hands and setting fire to anyone who tries to stop you works just fine for most Lavals, but that's no excuse to slack off when it comes to making weapons. Besides learning any kind of blacksmithing twice as fast as your peers, you're already a living legend. You can forge obsidian swords that cut straight through solid steel even when swung by a child, and your suits of stone armor would let people comfortably walk inside an erupting volcano or trek through a raging snowstorm. But you're not letting yourself stop there. With a special quenching technique wherein you use a lava flow instead of water or oil, you can reinforce any material or equipment capable of withstanding the required temperatures, improving physical qualities like hardness or sharpness thrice over.


-Matching and Mixing (The Weakness Of Beatrice) (600CP)
        If Mixing combines different ingredients to create new objects, like combining various plants to make powerful healing potions, what happens when you combine two or more of the same thing? Normally, nothing, it's a total waste of ingredients. It's not entirely impossible to find a way past that limitation and when you found that way, you rocketed past it to new heights of crafting power. You're able to combine multiples of the same thing to increase its overall power and utility. This can range from combining many corpses of the same being to create a super strong golem under your command to combining many Shining Weapons into one Frankenstein weapon that can channel an unholy shit-load of power at once.


-Non-Euclidean Mind (Generic Creepypasta) (600CP)
        Unique insight into the nature of reality has given you the somewhat troubling ability to bend space, or at least build structures that bend space. You can build things like buildings that are much bigger on the inside than their exterior would suggest, tunnels and halls that cross continents, even a series of connected spaces that randomly move you between them whenever you enter a door. The limiting factor is that you'd need to spend the same amount of resources as constructing the actual structure would be, although thankfully you won't need to spend as much time; a bigger on the inside house would use the amount of materials that the bigger insides suggest, for example. In addition, your twisted mind helps protect from mind reading, as your mind is as labyrinthine as your creations.


-Omni Crafting (The Weakness Of Beatrice) (600CP)
        Most Support classes are limited to one general area of work. Healers mix potions and medicines, constructors mix buildings and fortifications, smiths mix weapons and armour. Command and Passive spells only apply to your specialty, just like how someone who trains to become a blacksmith won't get any better at painting or drawing up building plans. You're some kind of Omni-Support class that not just ignores these limits, it shatters the very idea that you'd be so limited. Your crafting and Mixing abilities in one area can be used for any form of crafting or Mixing. Abilities that would normally improve the potency of your potions instead improve the power of your created weapons and vice versa. This also applies to your raw skills, allowing you to use skills in one crafting/creative discipline for other areas of work. That said, the skill scaling is a little weaker, in that only very broad specialties will carry over the full effect, while more specific forms of creating things gives a small benefit to other skills.


-Sacrificial Smith (Overlord - Games ) (600CP)
        If there is a tradition between all those Overlords and what they did, then that is using minions to empower whatever they forge, usually by having those that just spawned jump in the smelter in order to empower what is gonna be crafted. And you can not only do the same thing, so long you sacrifice minions in some way that involves the crafting process of what you are making.


-Sublimation (Fate/Legends - Vive La France) (600CP)
        Originality and uniqueness may certainly be the king of the high class art world but that's only when people can tell it's there. If not, a revision works just as well. Sublimation is the name of this capability you now have, which allows you to reproduce objects you have a chance to study and 'revise' them in the process, like stealing and rewriting a play.
        You'll need the desired item as a catalyst but this will let you slowly make copies of it, quality depending on the time and resources you invest into each one. A few hours is usually all it takes but already powerful items can take expensive, rare or dangerous to acquire materials to remake. More uniquely, your revision ability allows you to alter these catalysts. Again, basing the extent of the effect on time and resources, but you can certainly make a magical sword several times as powerful or add numerous new abilities to it, altering it's history or composition so that it always had those qualities.
        Perhaps a cart of raw materials from the local town square is all it'd take to take an ordinary iron blade and make it sharp enough to cut metal and alight in flame on command. But improving an already legendary blade like Durandal even moderately could take fortune's worth of materials that would already be difficult to attain, even for a king. There is not technically a limit on how far an object may be revised, though the cost of doing so will continue to grow greatly. Of course, selling your reproductions and revisions would certainly help build the fortune needed for something big.


-Titanic Mind, Tiny Body (The Circumstances Leading to Waltraute's Marriage) (600CP)
        It's rare that the dwarves let one of their grandmaster craftsmen out into the world. You must just be that special. You're a master unmatched by all but a tiny few at crafting all manner of magical and mundane objects, most of your peers being dwarves like yourself. Gungnir, Mjolnir, Gleipnir, these legendary objects and more are some of the things you could make, provided the time and resources were available. You are equally skilled at modifying already existing things too, finding it no different to add more onto an item than if you were making it from the ground up, even if it was already a complex mechanism. Lastly, all that you make carries a powerful dwarven curse that will afflict and harm any who use it without your permission, even those on a Divine level. This curse will cause terrible ailments and sicknesses to the trespasser until they have properly repented to you.


-World's Maker | Pandora's Child (Campione) (600CP)
        World's Maker (0CP)
        Chant: My inspiration is unending. My creations are peerless. My tools are unrivaled. My hands shall give birth to perfection only. For of all makers I reign as supreme Effect: Three effects come into play when this Authority is called forth. First, the user's creativity will be elevated to top even the greatest of artists, for the purpose of designing what he chooses to create. Second, a set of tools shall appear, perfect for whatever creation the user wanted to make. Third, the user shall gain temporary knowledge of magic to enchant, curse or bless his creation as he had envisioned. Be it buildings, songs, weapons, armor or the likes, even with the worst materials something that borders the divine can be made. Downsides: The user must have something he wants to make before calling the Authority. The materials are not provided for this. Depending on the creation, the time spent making it will vary. Once a project has been started, the Authority won't let another start until the first is done.
        Pandora's Child (600CP)
        Ah, the Campione, the unrivaled humans that managed the impossible: to slay a deity by themselves. They are Pandora's adopted children and the owners of a few advantages. Now, you're one of them too. As a Campione, you gain an allaround stronger body, grant you a natural talent to understand any language, an increase in mana that would make even the most untalented into a rival for a Paladin and a natural Magic Resistance that rivals the Gods themselves, making all mortal magic basically useless against you and greatly diminishing the magical attacks from Gods or other Campione. Also, your body will become near ageless, also having an accelerated healing and gaining magic senses if you didn't have them before. All in all, you could say that it improves everything about your body, not to mention that you also gain [Authorities] from any God you slay. Don't get too lazy because of this, I must warn you, many Campiones have fell after relying too much on their natural advantages, since there are ways to go around them.


-Hammer And Anvil | Gimmick and Trick | Fire and Ice (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - TG) (700CP)
Hammer And Anvil (100CP)
        It'd hardly be right to call you a smith if you couldn't even bang out a piece of metal, eh? You're a seasoned blacksmith, able to work metal and create all manner of useful metal objects - horseshoes, charms, and emblems...and of course, weapons and armor. The weapons and armor you create are reliable and easy to make, the kind used by Travelers and Soldiers all around Hyrule.
Gimmick and Trick (200CP)
        Arrows are a vital resource, not in the least because they are simple and easy to adjust. With your help, the humble arrow can go from a projectile to a problem solver! You now know how to make the 'trick' arrows utilized in Hyrule, the elemental arrows of fire, lightning and ice as well as the explosive bomb arrows. If you wished, you could extend this tinkering habit to non-projectiles, allowing you to create gimmick weapons and tools similar to that created by Kilton, proprietor of the Fang and Bone. In addition, if you have Hammer and Anvil, the quality of your crafted items is increased - allowing you to craft weapons of the quality of non-Hylian special weapons such as the Drillshaft or Gerudo Scimitar, or the quality of the weapons used by the Knights of Hyrule.
Fire and Ice (400CP)
        The mark of a true journeyman of the trade, you have learned how to infuse elemental properties into the weapons you've forged, as well as create the entirely elemental weapons known as Rods. Though both of these require some 'infused' mystical energy to make, once forged anyone can wield them. In addition, if you have Hammer and Anvil and Gimmick and Trick, your crafting expertise is now such that you could create weapons worthy of the Royalty of Hyrule itself, granted to their guardians or rewarded to those who have shown great skill as a hero - yet nothing quite unique. Not yet.


-Builder Package Tier One | Tier Two | Tier Three | Fragment of the Dream (Generic Island Castaway) (1100CP)
        Builder Package Tier One (100CP)
        Wood and other plant life. You are an exceptional builder with these and know the characteristics of such materials at a glance, you can also form mental blueprints and interact with them as if you actually saw them in the real world to assist in construction, as well as making infallible mental checklists of materials with exact steps, materials, and dimensions needed for the build, you also have an easy time locating useful materials you need for building and you take less time to build than you should.
        Builder Package Tier Two (200CP)
        Stone and crystals, you may now treat the builder package tier one as if it applies to these as well. You are also exceptionally good at locating and harvesting your needed materials while maximizing their yield and minimizing lost or damaged materials.
        Builder Package Tier Three (400CP)
        Metals and processed chemicals, treat these as if they also applied to the first two tiers, in addition to everything you construct now being far more durable than it would otherwise seem and taking less materials to construct than it should, you can also refine them to modern standards despite primitive conditions and lack of equipment.
        Fragment of the Dream (400CP)
        You carry within you a fragment of the God that dreamed up this island, boosting all the perks that you have purchased here. All purchased Builder tiers are boosted to supernatural levels, tier one now allows you to let others see your mental blueprints and cuts construction time to a fraction of what it should be, tier two now allows you to harvest larger amounts of the given materials then are physically present and causes the material site to slowly repair itself over time and tier three now allows you to apply desired characteristics to materials and construct things as if you had tools even if you don't.


-Mastercraft | Of the Elder Blood (The Witcher Novels) (1200CP)
        Mastercraft (700CP)
        What separates a Master from an Apprentice? No, not the fact that the current Master married his teacher's only daughter and inherited his position in the guild. A True Master of his craft is person whose work is akin to art. Perhaps even the Art snobbish sorcerers like to call their magic, because when someone looks at what was made by your hand they cannot believe it is not magic. When someone thinks about your chosen profession your name is often found to be synonymous to it.
        Not surprisingly the rich and powerful will easily agree to outrageous prices to own what you make. This is what it is to be the Master, but there is more, for you are gifted with talent for organization. Your subordinates always perform to the best of their abilities and always remain very loyal to you. Your businesses don't suffer from misfortune, working like well-oiled mechanisms as long as their focus is on your craft. They need so little oversight that you can spend your time on other pursuits almost without worry for your business.
        Eventually every master will take an apprentice, or several, and you can fully teach them what you know about your chosen art, almost regardless of how inept they are. They may not be able to surpass you but your legacy will live on through them and their work, and the work of their students and beyond, forever immortalizing your name. Even if history may not remember your other deeds expect to become a folklore hero in the future.
        Oh, and good news to you who are Gnomes! You are now also a master metallurgist and have mastered the art of Gwyhyr blades, which are known to be among the greatest weapons ever forged on the continent, with each blade being a masterful work of art. Those unfortunate enough not to be Gnomish may also gain this understanding of their metallurgy and metalworks.
        Of the Elder Blood (500CP)
        It appears that you are an unaccounted for relative of Ciri, by way of Laura Dorren, being an active carrier of the Elder Blood, as it seems that you can travel in the local multiverse; from shifting through time and space to crossing through worlds like stepping through a door, though your control over your ability is rather crude and in dire need of training before it becomes useful. But be wary, refining such a gift is a dangerous process, for the worlds are filled not just with wonders but horrors as well - how else do you think the monsters that witchers hunt appeared, other than when the worlds collided long ago?
--- Domain: Crafting: Biotech (27) (64 Perks) --- 
-Body Transfer (Empire From the Ashes) (100CP)
        The art and science of transferring a consciousness from body to body is a gory, ugly one. And it's one you know now. The how of moving brains from body to body, making sure no loss in memory or sanity occurs is within your grasp. And you can do it even with technology no more advanced than the 21st century. Of the world you started jumping from, smartass.


-Chromosome Analysis Specialist (Biomega) (100CP)
        Well, the job description said training would be provided - and sure enough, they provided you with all of the reading material you needed to figure out what you were actually supposed to do now that you're here. The researchers at the Data Recovery Foundation have been put to task into deciphering the secret behind the immortal cells, that mysterious 24th chromosome. From all of the information that has been compiled, you've acquired a better picture of what the DRF is planning - but as well, your ability to break down genetic information and just large chunks of information in general have improved. Heck, reading that 42 volume tome had to be worth something right?


-Crazed Physician (Van Helsing) (100CP)
        Amongst the many sciences and paths you know, aside from the usual Ominous Cackling, you... Can actually patch people up easily. As a Crazed Physician, you can use the plainest tools on hand to mend any variety of wounds and injuries. As well, you know the human anatomy down to the last blood vessel, and can learn the anatomy of any other creature you dissect more easily.


-Demonic Augmentation (Hellgate London) (100CP)
        You can successfully graft demonic parts onto yourself to gain an increase in mana reserves as well as gaining the ability to more easily cast certain spells based on the demon's type. You also learn to craft demonic focus items that, while weaker than augmentations, also don't have to be grafted onto your body.


-Medicine (GUNNM) (100CP)
        You have the skills of a surgeon, first-responder and pharmacist, all roughly bundled together with a lot of hands-on experience with the worst injuries the wasteland has to offer. Your hands are steady, your focus unperturbed by the sight and stench of gore and viscera, and you have the precise and quick reflexes necessary to swat a fly with a scalpel. You also have a fair bit of experience with slightly inhuman and mutated physiology, and are very quick to pick up on new techniques and tools.


-Medicine (Star Wars KOTOR) (100CP)
        Pretty much anyone can inject themselves with a stimpak or wrap an injury in bandages, but unlike you most people don't know how to do it right. You possess enough medical know how to make stimpaks and other quick healing items repair twice as much damage as they normally would and you can also treat minor injuries about as well as regular field medic. So long as you have the right supplies that is.


-Some Really Good String (Claymore) (100CP)
        You have a sizable supply of some really good string, if you were to cut someone's torso open and then reattach their torso with this string, somehow their core muscles would still function regardless of if the wound heals. They would also be able to perform incredible acrobatic feats as though there was nothing wrong regardless of how extreme their movements. As well even if they had their guts ripped open by a monster thrusting their arm all the way through the string itself would remain undamaged, and not even require any attention. Skill at stitching flesh back together is not required, or even mildly important, just shove it through and so long as it holds the wound together they'll be good to go.


-Specimen Bio-Tank (Resident Evil) (100CP)
        Well, your B.O.W. specimens have to come from somewhere don't they? They don't just pop out of the ground like those plebeian zombies, and what if you need to make some adjustments? Upon purchasing this, you gain access to a sophisticated bio-tank which is filled with a special fluid. This will not only ensure the B.O.W. is docile and unconscious while immersed, but it also comes with the tools and devices to monitor and make adjustments to the subject inside as needed. Evil laugh not included.


-Are you me? (Endless Space) (200CP)
        You possess intimate knowledge on Endless cloning technology, and can revive your fallen comrades with some of it. It costs a LOT of Dust, however, and you are not eligible for cloning. The clones are just that, and won't have exact memories or skills, but they will be pretty close to what they were before.


-Augmentation R&D (Deus Ex Human Revolution) (200CP)
        You have an extensive understanding of the underlying mechanics of DE:HR's cybernetic augmentation architecture; How it works, how it could work, and what avenues to analyse to see if it can be improved - and with time, brand new augmentations. In addition to this, your intelligence is increased to handle such a workload, alongside all the attendant knowledge necessary to mess with the human body - trauma surgery and fixing up broken individuals is an old hat to you, now.


-Biotech (Marvel Cosmic) (200CP)
        There are many fields of scientific and engineering expertise. They are all studied and mastered by assorted scientists across the universe. One of the most versatile and powerful fields is that of biotechnology. You are a veritable god in this field. Force evolve creatures at your whim, uplift entirely new species just because. Feel free to create biological interfaces with mechanical devices. The sky's the limit and flesh is your servant.


-Body Shop (Smash Up) (200CP)
        A good scientist pushing the bounds of human knowledge always has a use for raw materials. Here is a collection of preserved body parts from every species in the world, updating in future Jumps. Just never ask where it all comes from.
        * Extremely useful for any biological projects or research but perk text is slightly concerning if you take it seriously.


-Cradle (Marvel Cinematic Universe Vol. 1) (200CP)
        Weapons of war are not the only thing to advance, and this medical bed is proof of that. This human-sized medical device can heal wounds by scanning the wounded area and then regrowing skin tissue to a degree of accuracy that visually one wouldn't be able to tell there was a wound. If improved, there might be a way to let it 'grow' an entire body, but it would take a great degree of medical knowledge to sufficiently do so. There is then the issue of giving it a consciousness; it can create bodies but it cannot create life.


-FormOther Brand Medical Pod (Hive Queen Quest) (200CP)
        This medical pod is filled with an odd odorless liquid, when a being is placed inside it goes to work stabilizing and then healing them while simultaneously analyzing and storing information about their biology, which makes it incredibly useful for the study of new species. Large enough to fit a large man, fits more if the specimen has no bones Comes in either Technological or Biotech flavors, both function equally well.


-Grafting | Gourmet Cells (Toriko) (200CP)
Grafting (Toriko) (100CP)
With the impressive recovery and regenerative abilities of Gourmet Cells, your body can transcend the limits of biology. With this you can now graft human body parts to yourself with a hundred percent success rate and be able to use them effectively. Even more, you can graft the parts of other species and even plants onto your body to gain their abilities though a talented surgeon is still required.
Gourmet Cells (Toriko) (100CP)
You acquire either 3 Injections of Gourmet Cells capable of granting Gourmet Cells in a matter of hours or enough Gourmet Pills to grant 3 people Gourmet Cells over the course of a 5 year period through daily ingestion. Injections are a quick way to power up but very few survive the process while Pills have a significantly higher success rate but take time. Acquiring either grants you the ability to harvest Gourmet Cells and create your own Injections and Pills with trial and error. Plants and animals can both be injected or given pills so you may attempt to gather more cells at a later date.


-MEDICAL DOCTORATE (PREY) (200CP)
        Talos has no shortage of medical assistance, keeping the crew in top physical condition and studying the effects of Neuromods on the human psyche. Almost everyone in the Neuromod department has some medical background. Now you do too, either through your own education or through Neuromod injection. Basic medical supplies work better in your hands, sutures are guaranteed to hold through everything but the harshest of abuse and wounds cleaned by you never get infected. With more advanced supplies you're on par with the world's best heart surgeons. As a bonus, you can also identify and remove organs from the Typhon that are rich in the exotic material used in making Neuromods.


-Cybernetics (GUNNM) (300CP)
        You have a broad theoretical and practical knowledge of cybernetics and related engineering systems, and can recognize most systems with a glance. The most difficult repairs and programming come naturally to you, custom designs and components that would take an entire research team a month can be jotted down in an hour or so of casual work. The most common form of cyborg in the Scrapyard has an armoured braincase piloting a robotic body, but you're familiar with the organic-inorganic connection technology and can create partial cybernetics as well as organ replacements for those who do not wish to lose their bodies in effect, you are fully capable of the design, construction and application behind the Transhuman and Motorball cyborg perks.


-Make Me A Better Man! (Franken Fran) (300CP)
        Your skills of surgery do more than heal and correct. You can augment others with superhuman abilities and grant small portions of your power. If supernatural powers can be transferred through physical means, you can do so through surgery.


-Paved In Bones (The Matrix) (300CP)
        When one thinks about it, the human body is kind of like a Machine as well. It uses electricity, it requires fuel, it's complex, and it can break down. Why not study it and see what can be done? Whether you sifted through stolen data files or got hands-on with your work, you've figured out a great deal of things about the human body. Its mutations, its limits, its potential... how it all works is open to you, including how the Machines managed to grow their plugs inside the body. What you do with this knowledge is up to you.


-Structural Biology (Half-Life) (300CP)
        The anatomy of specimens, both exotic and usual, is key to understanding how they work. You have an instinctive understanding of how living things work, how tough they are, and how interactions between biochemical reactions work.


-4th Imperium Cybernetics (Empire From The Ashes) (400CP)
        You are a master of the technology that the fourth Imperium used to design its processing systems and AIs, not to mention other civilian systems. You have a complete, total grasp of the techniques used to design everything from fold-space communicators to energy state processors for AIs. You could design the finest computers the 5th Imperium ever found or made from a 21st century resource base.


-Alchemical R&D (Buso Renkin) (400CP)
        You went down this path of your own free will, and since no one would willingly grant you such amazing powers without a price you had to learn everything yourself. Because of this you know everything there is to know about making homunculus, down to the best place to insert the embryos. That being said, you can't do any of this without a laboratory and whatever DNA you plan on incorporating.


-Arateus Genetics (Stargate: Atlantis) (400CP)
        You have extensive knowledge of the Arateus bug and its unusual genes, which can be incorporated into human DNA. The sciences of Human/Wraith hybridisation, the retroviruses that can cause or reverse the hybridisation process, and a novice's understanding of their feeding process are yours. This allows you - with the right materials, samples, test subjects and a lab - to create genetic chimeras and bug monsters from Arateus DNA, or cure those who have been transformed thus. Post-jump, you can learn to do the same with other similar biological abominations.


-Bio Lab (Buso Renkin) (400CP)
        Homunculi don't really breed, so their reproduction is instead linked to creating more of their own. What this purchase does is add a respectable sized laboratory to either your property, or the warehouse, which contains all that you need (including instructions) on how to create basic humanoid and animalistic homunculi.


-Biosynthetics (Biomega) (400CP)
        Focusing on what science was available, mankind worked towards a harmonious merge of biology and technology - with the ultimate aim of immortality. Well, they're not quite there yet, or at least, the majority of people aren't quite there yet, but they've managed to merge humans with machines very well. Synthetic appendages, weapon prosthesis, modified senses, internal energy generators, and so forth are all rather commonplace in 3005AD. You'll have an intermediate understanding of the science behind biosynthetics, or a boost if you already knew it to begin with.


-Bioweaponry (Stargate: Atlantis) (400CP)
        While a prohibited field of study on Earth, it doesn't seem to bother the IOA or SGC if the research is happening in another galaxy or being used on Wraith (who aren't "technically" humans). You have the skill to convert virii or bacterial agents into bioweapons, tinker with their virulence and lethality, and design the all-important delivery devices.
-Body of a Servant (Monster Girl Encyclopedia) (400CP)
Like a Shoggoth, you can reshape the cells of your body to create any organ you wish, and that’s just the tip of the iceberg.  You can also split off and shape your body’s cells/organs into various items that mimic the function of the actual items.  For instance, even if you are normally vulnerable to fire, a frying pan you made with your body would be resistant to heat.  It’s fairly easy to make mundane items using your body, but especially complex items, such as magical artifacts or especially advanced technology, would require a lot more concentration on your part (and maybe a little extra energy) to get things right.  Please also keep in mind that these items are being created from your body mass, so unless you have a way to regenerate your mass you might not want to make too many things at one time.
-Chimeric Fusion (Monster Girl Encyclopedia) (500CP)
With their new forms, beings such as Chimaeras that used to have multiple heads and bodies have fused together into single forms, with one face and one body yet the powers of the different parts combined.  Similarly, you can combine different physical bodies you have into a form that combines different aesthetic qualities of each form and allows you to access all of the abilities normally restricted to the single forms.  However, none of the fused powers from one of the forms will be quite as strong as they would be if you just used that single form.  In addition, you have learned the ancient sorcery used to create Chimaera hybrids by fusing multiple beasts together and enchanting their heart(s) with darkness if they were not already demon beasts.  Furthermore, you can use this magic to also fuse beasts to your body to gain their own special powers.  However, since they are not a natural part of you, the beasts can resist the fusion, with the level of success depending on their willpower and intelligence; even after they fuse to you, their individual personalities will remain intact, and may lead to your mind shifting to their personas now and then.  You can reverse the fusions at any point if you want to.


-Chimerical Genius (Revelation Space) (400CP)
        The science of cybernetic augmentation is quite mature in this day and age, and you are at the forefront of combining flesh with machine. The cybernetics you design and install are not only top-of-the-line in terms of their function and performance, but are also very aesthetically pleasing, either matching the contours of the body or in startling contrast. The parts you could build are so durable that they are quite likely to survive long past the person they are attached to: even under such an assault where the flesh is unrecognizable, the chimeric parts you installed would still likely be useable to the degree of being able to install them into another person. You may not be quite at the notorious level of Dr Trintingent, but if you've been a doctor for long, it's likely you have a small following of fans of your work among the chimeric demographic.


-Chrysalis (Starcraft - The Zerg) (400CP)
        A human sized, pulsating Chrysalis that.... Looks oddly familiar. Wait, you know why now. This was the same kind of pod that was formed around the one known as Sarah Kerrigan, where abathur remade the Ghost into the Queen of Blades, now it seems you can do the same, any organic subject around the size of an average human will go into a deep sleep when fastened into the Chrysalis, during which you can modify them to a level of detail only seen in individuals like Alexi Stukov. Although you will need the knowledge to properly utilize it, the Chrysalis gives all the benefits of a professional, well-funded surgery room in it's compact organic form.


-Evolutionary Incentive (Ben 10 0.1) (400CP)
        If you have been paying even the slightest bit of attention, you will notice a lot of powers in this multiverse come from the unique biology of different alien species. So naturally, it makes perfect sense to want to harness it and perhaps play with the mechanics a little bit. You are a master of capturing and manipulating DNA using technology, able to mutate creatures into something new by playing with their genetics like play-doh, giving them new powers or even ironing out things like genetic illnesses or defects. You're better at mixing and matching than making anything from scratch, but eventually you can learn how to recreate certain superpowered genetics from one alien species in another using surgery or even small technological devices. You're not quite making the next Omnitrix with this alone, but this definitely sets the foundation for it.


-Genetic Engineering (World Seed) (400CP)
        While robots and machines are interesting enough, it would be foolish to think that technology is limited to steel and metal. You have knowledge of a field of technology that goes beyond the conventional. Rather than mechanical engineering, you do genetic engineering. You can grow any technology you could normally create organically instead, and give life to terrors of plants and beasts. Instead of cars you could make reptilian mounts, and instead of hammering together a spaceship you could grow it in orbit. I can't imagine it would be fun to fight against a ship that had a giant row of teeth. But further than that, you could combine the best of these two fields of technology. Machines that heal like organic beings, but a thousand times faster, flesh and scales with the toughness of titanium, and muscles with strength on par with any machine. Robots able to reproduce and propagate like natural lifeforms, and organic brains with the power of the best Artificial Intelligence. I'm sure you can see the potential this offers.


-Genetic Improvements (Starbound) (400CP)
        Why settle for what Mother Nature gave you? You have the knowledge to tweak and refine genetic code, including your own, bringing out hidden qualities and introducing new ones from other samples. You know how to build the technology needed for these sorts of feats, and have a basic grounding in the appropriate scientific areas.


-Hand of Science (Anarchy Reigns) (400CP)
        All we know now is that science reigns supreme. You're a licensed surgeon, specializing in cybernetic implants. With the right tools, you can give someone a cybernetic arm or leg, whether they already had a missing limb or you had to chop one off to make room. On top of that, you know how to weaponize cybernetic limbs as well, and can integrate weapons into them without detracting from their function or aesthetic.


-Implanter (Empire From The Ashes) (400CP)
        You are a master of this branch of Imperial Technology, being a whiz with the biology, cybernetics and enhancement science needed to design, build and implant the many, many kinds of enhancements that were so common among them.
        You start off being able to reliably, indeed excellently, design the Basic Implants that were provided to even the Junior-most fleet officers, soldiers and in the Fifth Imperium, even to ordinary citizens. But as you practice this skill, as you strain your mind, more ideas come to you, revealing more and more advanced designs. Put in some serious work into it, and you could be designing the codes, software and the hardware components typically used by Fleet Captains and Planetary Dukes in no time!
        This skill will continue to grow, and you may, with a lot of time and effort, even design implants that could grant sapience to the non-sapient, much as how the scientist Cohanna would use her ability in this art to make ordinary dogs into near-human intelligences.


-M.O. Surgeon (Terra Formars) (400CP)
        You know the Organic Mosaic Procedure's ins-and-outs like the back of your hand. As a result, you can perform the surgery on anybody, be it human or animal, and they will not need the transformative serum as well. On top of that, while the normal survival rate of the procedure is 35%, your skills with it have increased such a dramatic amount that nine times out of ten, your patient will survive the Procedure.


-Mad Geneticist (Rick And Morty) (400CP)
        Sometimes science is more art than science and you find that this is doubly true when it comes to genetics. When you have a vague idea of the attributes you want to impart from a species you find them remarkably easy to splice into a different species. It won't even backfire that often. Probably. Be careful.


-Man and Machine (Generic Cyberpunk) (400CP)
        The line between the two can be blurry in this world, but an engineer of your skills can make it vanish. You're a whiz with cybernetics of all kinds, able to design, build, repair, and even implant them with expert skill. Beyond just making the body embrace these additions as if they were natural if new parts of the whole your expertise allows you to work with and design implants and devices capable of all kinds of things. From in-built cloaking systems, dermal armor able to deflect and ignore military grade arms fire, dash systems, defensive fields, weapons, and much more. You could turn anybody from just another person into a walking example of posthumanity if you had the resources. Your talent in this field ensures you'll be able to adapt any of your technology into some form of useful cybernetic. Who knows where you'll take the field as time goes on.


-Sample Collection (Generic Naruto Fanfiction) (400CP)
        Oh, what's this now? Doing some experiments, are we? Well, if you are, these would be priceless. This is a comprehensive collection of DNA samples, with blood, hair, nails and even bone samples from... well, just about everyone who's anyone!
        That's right. This is a collection of neatly labeled samples that have materials from very nearly every powerful ninja, samurai, random guy, demon, sage... pretty much anyone who can be considered A-class or above in the Bingo Book. The exact nature and quantity of the samples depends on the people in question and their histories. That is, someone who keeps getting injured would likely have extensive blood samples here, but for someone for whom it's a rarity you would likely see only stuff like hair and skin, and quantities dependant on how easy it tends to ordinarily be to get those things from them.
        The exception is for dead people, in which case you get significant quantities of everything from blood, bone, skin... well, everything. Each and every sample is perfectly preserved, and experiments performed on them have significantly higher chances of success than normal. In future jumps too, you get samples from all major figures in the setting, whether in terms of fighting strength, intellect or the rest.


-The Very Model of a Scientist Salarian (Mass Effect) (400CP)
        You've studied species turian, asari and batarian (and more). You're quite good at genetics (as a subset of biology) because you are an expert (which you know is a tautology). Your xenoscience studies range from urban to agrarian, you are the very model of a scientist salarian. Can sing a little. Little you cannot give insight into due to your vast range of knowledge. Little that you have a hard time getting into due to your vast starting base. You could brute-force the vast majority of "impossible" scientific endeavors in this world with your relentless application of logic.


-Xenobiologist (DOOM 3) (400CP)
        The denizens of hell are equally terrifying and magnificent, in their own way. You have been extensively trained in the biological sciences, yet even your understanding is merely a starting point for these strange beings. Superhuman strength and resilience, the ability to manifest and control confined plasma charges, teleportation you don't know how they do it. But you will. Your talents grant you immense insight into any biological system, and through study and research, you'll eventually be able to understand even the most bizarre and alien biologies and, with enough skill, even replicate them. Hell is the way forward, and you intend to study it every step of the way.
        This Perk grants you a 50CP stipend which you may use in the Mysteries Of Mars or Hell's Might sections found further in this document.


-Commencing Operations (Franken Fran) (500CP)
        As an accomplished surgeon, you know the best ways to cut people up and put them back together with a minimum of fuss and damage.
        Cosmetics Make people look just like their dreams come true. Grecian perfection? Sure! Picasso's Cubism? Take a number! The only limit is your imagination! (No augments apply)
        Transplants Transplant fully functional organs between genders, ages, blood types and species. Biochemical barriers, what's that? Organs must be mostly intact.
        Trauma If they're still warm and bleeding, they ain't dead yet. Not when you get your hands on them. I can't say much for their condition, but they will stabilize.
        Disease You practically write the book on contagions, lord knows how many you've made. Even knowledge of parasites and poisons won't be far from you. A cure is swift to follow.
        Mental Through drugs, surgery, hypnosis and or therapy, the mental scars are as much your domain as anything else. Cure neuroses with year-long processes in mere days or hours, resolve memory loss and even carve personalities and minds to any shape.
        * All five are included in the perk cost.


-Fleshcrafting (Dune) (500CP)
        The Tleilaxu have thousands of years of knowledge in how to manipulate living forms, whether tinkering with genes outright or through breeding programs, and are able to apply that toward virtually any end with enough time and effort. Using only in-universe tools, you can expect to exercise a great deal of patience in your work, but the abominations that the Tleilaxu keep behind closed doors prove their method. If you were to use more... traditional methods of genetic engineering, coupled with the knowledge given here, you could produce truly remarkable things, whether changing a man into a monster or the pinnacle of human evolution. Even without that, the existence of ghouls (zombie-like killing machines that convert what they kill into more ghouls) and leeches (biological tanks) as well as biomechanical hardware are stark proof of the efficiency of the Tleilaxu gene-forging.


-My Experiments (Lilo and Stitch) (500CP)
        The true mark of a Mad Scientist, is the minions under his control. And these children you have created are truly the finest around. You have all the knowledge to build the tools and enact the science, behind creating your own mischievous creatures. The powers they have can range from practically useless, to an unstoppable monstrosity. Their personality is completely up to you. Whilst you have these capabilities, there's a reason they call them experiments. It will take many attempts to work out how to create the exact specimen you want. Even the greatest of scientists may fail 625 times before bringing about their great destroyer. But with enough time and effort, you will eventually gather enough skill in the subject to get the exact creature you want every time.


-Animojo (Ben 10) (600CP)
        When it comes to genetics you're one of the best in the universe. Not only can you manipulate the DNA of living things to change them to suit your purpose, but you can even bring long dead species back to life. On top of all this, you also possess the knowledge to build the equipment you need from components you would find at your local electronic and home repair stores.


-Biology As A Guideline (Franken Fran) (600CP)
        Grow freaky biological monstrosities like pheromone spewing fungi and living theme park mascots. Modify animals into things from mythology. Graft human heads onto animal bodies and vice versa. Create life! With just this you might not be as good as a Madaraki, maybe a Moreau, but you're a convincing substitute.


-Biotechnology (GUNNM) (600CP)
        There's really more to cybernetics than just the metal machine. Care has to be taken that the flesh adapts, and there are many lessons to be learned from biological machinery. You're an expert in the fields of genetics, biophysics, toxicology, neuropharmacology and biochemistry the causes and effects of human mutation are very familiar to you. Designer drugs, experimental surgery, toxins, cures improved soft organs and cutting-edge research into cloned nervous system material, with a laboratory the human body is your masterpiece. You may create a variety of drugs similar to that referenced in the Werewolf perk, or directly induce it and Warped as a permanent mutation. If you also have the Cybernetics perk, then with a little time and the right equipment quite difficult to obtain in the Scrapyard you may also apply the equivalent of the TUNED perk to a subject, and have additional knowledge of weapons engineering to reverse-engineer or independently develop most current weapons systems available in the Scrapyard.


-Cobra-La background: Biotechnology (G.I Joe) (600CP)
        You were born of the nobility of Cobra-La, an ancient civilization that dominated the Earth and retreated to a protective dome during the Ice Age. You left the Dome around the same time Cobra Commander was sent out to try to destroy human civilization. If you take this option Cobra-La will be placed in the Gi Joe setting you went to, and will be an issue at some point. Though probably in a similar vein to the movie, but might be a reoccurring friend/foe. If you join Gi Joe or a drop in and take this option, you are a traitor to your people and can expect a Spore bath if they catch you. If you are a member of Cobra, Cobra Commander takes much of the blame as he did in the movie, and you are not blamed for Cobra's failure. Though Globius might have a low opinion on you depending on how you acted.
        Cobra-la biotechnology: You leave Cobra-La with a fairly in depth knowledge of Cobra-La's biotechnology. Its not all comprehensive but will get better in time. As such you can make biological items, weapons, and vehicles equivalent to or surpassing their hard tech counterparts. You can also identify biotech and will have a good idea of how it works and what it does. This would also apply to other Jump's with biotechnology and means you can master those sciences easier. Even truly alien ones. By the time you leave the Jump you can even upgrade humans into bio-soldiers in much the same manner as Cobra-La can, and make truly impressive (also weird and bizarre) biotech.


-Essence Spinner (Starcraft - The Zerg) (600CP)
        You know the essence and DNA and you know the exact strands with which to induce a variety of mutations and evolutions upon zerg organisms under your control. With a simple feather from a cliff-jumping raptor or the acidic spit from a predatory beetle, you can break down the essence and proteins within each of these to their building blocks and re-assemble them into a strain fit for yourself and your minions. As a bonus, you can produce a simple silk-like screen that allows you to manipulate these strains and magnify them into a view capable of being seen from even a simple human eye. Said silk screen also allows you to manipulate these strands by hand.


-Fleshcrafter (Claymore) (600CP)
        You know the processes behind the creation of Half Yoma, Abyss Feeders, and even just cobbling together flesh into a rather long lived, and hard to kill body. If it's a secret known to the organization of working flesh anything from humans to Asarakam, you know it all, and can even go beyond in time. You do at least know exactly how to ensure that every half yoma you produce is at a level near the top ranks of warriors within the organization. With a little effort you could find a way to produce them without a stigma, or create ones that don't show their nature through bleaching their body of pigment and turning their eyes silver.


-Go To Hel (Kamen Neo-Heisei Rider Part 2.5 - Gaim) (600CP)
        It would appear you have happened across an oddly fertile patch of Helheim. Any seeds you plant here will grow into Helheim plants that produce Lockseeds of the source of the seeds. You could even try crossbreeding the resulting plants to create Lockseeds that grant armaments based on a mix of the two donor plants. While this can get you some very potent Lockseeds, keep in mind it won't necessarily scale directly with the fruits, and something on the level of the Forbidden Fruit would take ages of effort and many unusual fruits to even begin to approach it. After the jump, this patch becomes attached to your Warehouse, giving you a stable Helheim patch free of Invess except any you make.


-Genius of Osakabe (Arpeggio of Blue Steel) (600CP)
        You are privy to the secrets of Professor Osakabe, the creator of the Design Children. This skill in genetics allows you to create 'test-tube babies' from donor samples and genetically enhance them for specific traits most notably, their intelligence, memory retention, creativity, intuition and reasoning. Such children have the potential to change the nation maybe even the world before they so much as hit puberty, far surpassing the intellect of any natural human and coming up with creative schemes that the Fog could never imagine. Please use this talent carefully even the brilliant professor himself was unable to prevent more than a fraction of 'his' children from dying, and that nearly destroyed him. I hope, for your sake and theirs, that you are able to iron out any flaws in the process.


-Greenfinger (Starbound) (600CP)
        You have a great power, the ability to commune with and control any and all forms of plant life. Beyond even that, however, is your ability to grow plants under your control which can mimic the effects of technology. You need some understanding of the underlying principles, but once you have that, organic teleporters, plasma weapons, spaceships, and more are all possibilities.
        These technologies can retain benefits of their plant-like origin, including photosynthesis, regeneration, and other plant-based attributes.


-Guardian Angel (Overwatch) (600CP)
        Doctor Angel Zieger, also known as Mercy, was renowned as an unparalleled medical genius even in her teens, being recruited to the medical division of Overwatch before she was even 18 and becoming the head of a hospital even before that. Her medical skills have literally brought the dead back to life and her technology is so advanced that it seems like magic. there is no one in the world able to even compare to her in her area of expertise. No one, that is, save for you. Your base medical knowledge is encyclopedic, your hands are almost mechanically accurate when performing surgery. Your technology is advanced to almost impossible standards, including things such as a staff that can engage a healing stream to rapidly regen people from a distance. Your knowledge may even allow you to slow the rate of aging


-Making Monsters (Pokemon Sword and Shield) (600CP)
        Although incredible, the study of fossils and their revival isn't exactly a new field of research. There is someone in Galar making what some would call a breakthrough, and others would call crimes against nature, relating to the field. Would you like to become a genius? On purchase, you will acquire a wealth of information relating to fossil revival technologies, such as what the process of fossil revival entails and how the technology works. In a more expansive step however, comes the knowledge on methods for splicing pre existing life forms into something new. Although most of your expertise in that second field comes from using fossil revival on partial fossils of different creatures to revive them as something strange and new, you also have some knowledge on doing that through other means, though mostly as a starting point. In addition to just being able to make such things, you're somehow quite skilled with making sure this hybrid lifeform has the strengths and qualities of its parts, in spite of how unlikely it should be for such things to even survive, much less thrive. Maybe that will help others ignore your depraved acts.
-MASTER OF THE MIND (PREY) (600CP)
        The knowledge to create Neuromods. We're not just talking about those hypos with exotic material either, but to be able to create the programs that you upload to the mind itself. With this, all the secrets of the human mind are laid bare to you, if you look at an active neuron you could tell what it's function is in the mind. You can take the scans the specific skills of anyone and create a new Neuromod suitable for human use. Skills can be recorded through mere observation utilising a device called a Psychoscope, though the skill you wish to collect must be being practiced by the target or be a significant part of their personality. A great musician doesn't need to be composing in order for you to scan him for his musical talent, but if you wanted his ability to cook you'd need to scan him while he was cooking. It has also been demonstrated to be possible to install abilities from alien biology, providing the user has access to sufficient quantities of any special material the ability relies on and they're okay with hybridising their biology with the species.


-Noetic Science (Trinity: Aeon) (600CP)
        You have engaged in a deep, in-depth study of the mechanics behind your new abilities. You are considered an expert among the orders on the nature of both the Noetic universe, and to a lesser degree, the effects of Taint on the world. You also have enough knowledge of the biological sciences that you could modify or design new biotech, though you're still a long way from understanding the Prometheus chambers. The Tesser drives that power the interstellar teleportation Modes built into the Leviathan Jumpships are a little beyond you, but you'll figure them out with a few more years of study. Perhaps you could design other kinds of biotech with limited Psi powers?


-Paraphysician (Trinity: Aberrant) (600CP)
        Rashoud facilities around the world are ready to take in newly-erupted Novas and teach them how to use their powers. Training typically involves biofeedback exercises, practical lessons within shielded labs, and a crash course in quantum physics. After joining Utopia you continued your studies and acquired several degrees, eventually becoming a licensed Paraphysician. Through observation and testing you can develop ways to quantify and categorize the mechanics of how individuals access superhuman powers. While you won't instantly understand the hows and whys behind a power, it's easy for you to create training methods to ease and speed the development of these powers and design chemicals and equipment to mitigate any side-effects that those powers may have. As a side note, you've mastered the skills of Dormancy and Attunement to a degree that most Novas never will and can easily teach these skills to other Novas.


-Personal Analysis (E.V.O. Search for Eden) (600CP)
        You possess an innate and intricate understanding of the natural processes of your form, whatever those might be, down to the sub-atomic level. This means you have an incredible understanding of things like your body chemistry, cellular activity, and much more. This extends to forms in your Record of Evolution, letting you examine and understand them in incredible detail as well. Also excellent in diagnosing any health issues or damage you've sustained, or guiding your evolution with a precision that would be impossible otherwise.


-The Flesh is Strong (Hive Queen Quest) (600CP)
        The hive thrives on the strength of its parts, every drone born for a specific job, every life a cog in the mighty machine working for the good of all, all serving the queen. Through long hours of research (and the hard work of your thinkers) you have learned to assimilate not only the tools of nature to add to your drones strength but also the tools of others. With study you can replicate machinery as biotech, studying a vibrating blade powered by servos for instance may allow you to recreate it by growing a chitinous blade powered by micro muscles while studying a ships blink drive may allow you to grow your own out of hundreds of interlocking "cog" drones. As a plus should you be a queen you can apply these changes to your children before you lay their egg, altering their form as you see fit to grant them the boons of technology and nature from birth.


-The Science of Evolution (E.V.O. Search for Eden) (800CP)
        Theory? To you evolution is an entire scientific field in it's own right, one you have more than mastered. From the how, to the why, to mathematics to quantify and calculate it, to the crystals and other devices to manipulate and interact with it, to even the quantum physics that influence it at the smallest levels of reality. This knowledge is essentially the complete and collected data from all of the evolution that has taken place on Earth, up to the birth of civilization. The question is, what will you do with this knowledge? While the bulk of it relates to biological evolution, it'd only take a little effort on your part to apply this to the evolution of non-biological systems, such as computer viruses or society.


-Virology (Prototype) (600CP)
        Looking at it from a technical standpoint, viruses are just devices that carry genes, they enter the nucleus, insert their genome, and then the host cell does everything else for them. This characteristic makes viruses one of the most favored devices in genetic engineering, as they can go and infect multiple cells. The folks at Gentek know this, and focus solely on them, but you have a leg up on them. By extensive study (but still far less than a computer could) you can decode the entire genome of a life-form, and decode and isolate the genes responsible for any and every trait that they possess. Want the eyes of a goat on the body of a snake? Or possibly just the strength of a rhinoceros? Do not look away, study and decode today!


-Karma Chameleon (GUNNM) (900CP)
        Your biology isn't content to just sit around and wait for the next generation to surpass it. A constant internal struggle, a genetic hothouse under your skin - writhing tests of new muscle fibres, skin weaves, neuron insulation, circulatory system innovations your body is constantly tweaking and advancing itself to better fit with the demands placed upon it. This isn't just reactive evolution, though it is that - it's the brute-force computation of a billion tiny computers, a constant drive to exploit every advantage. While it's very slow, you may find yourself growing internal electroreceptors when your cells notice that most of the really dangerous things around you have EM signatures, or find your dietary preferences shifting to include metals and silicon to reinforce your bones and slowly hybridise into a truly biological robot. When you do actually struggle and fight and bleed, this process is sped up by an order of magnitude in the course of a single fight you might find your blood incorporating foaming clotting agents, or your eyes and visual cortex adapting to cyborg-speed combat. You can ultimately develop any biological ability you want, though whether you get it is based on your cleverness in providing the right evolutionary pressures - you might want a secondary heart and end up with none at all. Additionally, while results never really cease, they tend to plateau when you cannot actually challenge yourself meaningfully in life-or-death situations. Any other biological powers that you have benefit from this as well, constant tweaks and adaptations that may not be quite what you expect, but always fulfil a purpose.


-Botanist | Genius (Plants Vs Zombies) (1000CP)
        Botanist (600CP)
        Ah, come on, you knew this perk was coming. You are an amazing botanist now. Not only do you have a comprehensive grasp of botany in the real world, but you also gain an extremely rapid understanding of plants of all types just by looking at them once. You can tell what their best conditions of growth are, how they could be enhanced and improved, all sorts of things. You're also able to modify them, rather extensively at that. You have a talent for designing plants, making incredibly beautiful or sturdy versions, or even both.
        Genius Boosted: You skills with plants are now the equal of David Blazing himself! You can design plants for all sorts of purposes now, including things no one has any business using plants for. Biology, the Laws of Physics or Common Sense, nothing can stop in your way as you grant frankly ridiculous powers to your creations. You could design Chillies that explode, Squashes that Squash enemies, or Cherries that Explodonate. More than this, you're more than capable of giving them full and complete Sapience, so much so that they could go to college, even.
        Genius! (400CP)
        You are an absolute Genius, with this perk! Your mind works tens, hundreds of times as fast as even the most clever of your fellows, excepting the true once-in-a-millennium genii like the one or two people in this world. You have an eidetic memory, and absolutely perfect recall, making sure you never forget anything. More than that, you are capable of wonders of science that would leave anyone around you gaping in awe. Creating sapience is child's play, as is working with both Trees and Plants or human flesh, letting you make wonders and abominations. While you're rather far from being able to make things like either the Plants or Zombies used here, you could learn very quickly indeed, being clever as you are. This perk is a capstone booster for each Origin capstone, and the interactions are listed with the capstones.
        * Subtract 400 from the cost if you already have the genius! Perk from Defender






--- Domain: Crafting: Metallurgy (28) (26 Perks) --- 


-Oblation to Onsi (Elder Scrolls Online) (100CP)
        From separating the low-carbon steel from the high-carbon steel to identifying obscure metals like Lilandril steel and the so-called "bog iron" found in peat deposits, you've got a solid basis of knowledge and skills that allow you to work as a blacksmith for all but the most discerning of clients (and with practice, even those as well!) Any set of plate or any melee weapon crafted from metals of up to Rank Five (ebony, which for some reason is much less impressive in ESO than it is in every other Elder Scrolls setting) is a trivial task for you, provided you have the tools and resources on hand.


-Smith (Generic Builder) (100CP)
        You have a particular talent for creating anything a blacksmith/armorsmith/weaponsmith might create. Any such crafted object is half again as durable as it would otherwise be. Creation times are halved and your natural talent increases with each purchase of this knack.
        * Can be taken indefinitely for creation time modifiers


-Blacksmithing (Golden Sun) (200CP)
        You gain understanding of Weyard blacksmithing. While skilled in smithing typical metals, you also learn how to use strange and magical materials to forge powerful enchanted weapons, equipment, and artifacts. Power is decided by your personal skill, the magic of the material involved, and the quality of your forge. Items created with materials from Weyard typically require the user to be an adept to tap into their strength.


-Goron Crafting (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - SB) (200CP)
        You know the secrets of the Goron Craftsmen. You can create metal armors that can render the wearer immune to heat, powerful hammer-blades that can smash through the toughest rocks, advanced Bomb Arrows that won't explode from ambient heat, and more. Anything built by Gorons, you can recreate, so long as you can gather the right materials.


-Skyforge (The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim) (200CP)
        An ancient, mysterious, eagle themed forge added to your warehouse. Any metal items crafted at the forge will be significantly harder and stronger for it. Something about the fires.


-Smithing (Thundercats 2011) (200CP)
        The ancient art of working with metal to forge weapons and armor. You know how to make beautiful equipment that can survive countless battles and you could even forge a legendary weapon if you dedicated enough time to it, although it'd probably take at least several years to complete.


-Smithing (Wakfu) (200CP)
        You know how to make weapons and armor from all sorts of raw materials. From Scarabug wings to Blibli tusk and Gobball hooves, you can turn just about anything you'd find in nature into genuine combat equipment the more powerful the creature it came from, the stronger the equipment will be.


-Zora Crafting (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - SB) (200CP)
        You have the skills of a Zora Craftsman. You can create suits of flexible armor that boost the wearer's ability to swim, mighty spears and tridents, powerful Ice Arrows that leave waves of cold in their wake, and more. Any item or structure that a Zora has built, you can recreate, given time and appropriate materials.


-Alloy Smith (The Avengers - Earth's Mightiest Heroes) (300CP)
        Advanced knowledge of chemistry and metallurgy has allowed you to create alloys out of various materials, including metals and chemicals. These new alloys retain all of the properties- including those that are supernatural in nature- of the materials used to make them, allowing you to create truly powerful substances.


-Blacksmith (Generic Xianxia) (300CP)
        Weapons and armour are not useless in this world. Indeed, one of sufficient talent may create arms and armour that can (and usually do) mean the difference between victory and defeat for those who use them. You are able to make equipment with special traits and great power to aid the one who wields and wears them. What the gear is able to do and how strong it is is dependent on your skill, the processes used, and the reagents that go into their creation - for example, if you wanted to make a flaming sword, you would need a source of magical or conceptual fire to infuse into the blade. With sufficient time and skill the stuff you make can decide the fate of nations, planets, and even entire dimensions. Furthermore the arms and armor you can create are nearly half-again as powerful as they would otherwise be, given similar materials, time, and effort in their creation.


-Blacksmithing: Zen Master (World of Warcraft) (300CP)
        Smith various melee weapons, mail and plate armor, and other useful trade goods like skeleton keys, shield-spikes and weapon chains to prevent disarming. Blacksmiths can also make various stones to provide temporary physical buffs to weapons.
        At this level you've mastered everything from basics to advanced. Additionally you've expanded your knowledge of the profession beyond the mastery of both basics and advanced stuff to complete understanding of it. At this level you're on an even playing field with the top 1% of your profession. Should you write down your knowledge it would easily be considered a work of art in that field.


-Munechika’s Legacy to Future Smiths (Golden Sky Stories) (300CP)
These are the notes of one Munechika Sanjou – one of the blacksmiths who forged the five swords under heaven – blades of renown in this land. Though his notes are rather tattered and sparse, they still possess a wealth of information for any aspiring blacksmith.
Any piece you create is far more likely to become a recognized masterpiece, and should you inscribe a signature onto a piece, you can weave an ability into the weapon to empower them. Any who reads these notes can perform such a task, but the quality of their work will be dependent on their own skill.


-Soul Smith (Dark Souls) (300CP)
        Well for one, this makes you a pretty good blacksmith with an emphasis on repair, able to repair most normal weapons, armor and trinkets with the right materials and a bit of time. You're also pretty good at forging and upgrading normal weapons and armor. There is more to this craft than you would first think, as Smiths in this world are capable of several unique acts. In this land, smiths can use special stones to imbue weapons with various types of power, such as Fire or Lightning, during the forging process. Given enough time and practice, they can even forge powerful souls into their handiwork to create unique and often times powerful equipment. While this skill doesn't make you the best in the world at this craft, it gives you a solid foundation with room to improve.


-Volcanic Forge (God of War) (300CP)
        The Smith God's power is great, but it is not by his will alone that his works are forged. There is also his tools to consider, and with this you have one such tool.
        Attached to your Warehouse is a small volcano, a fiery beast that will never fade and never falter. Its power is great, reducing the time you need to break down metals and minerals, reworking them into new forms while increasing their quality and inherent strengths. Should you choose, you may also take a significant hit in forging time to experiment with different metals and minerals, melting and combining them to create a different, newer resource with one quality from the second object in question. Rise, craftsman. Rise and begin your work.


-Ambient Magic: Smith (Circle of Magic) (400CP)
        A form of Fire Magic, it allows the sensing and manipulation of metals, ores, and other materials used in Smithing (like coal), resistance to fire and burning metal, resistance to smoke damage to lungs, and varying levels of fire manipulation. It is practiced by Daja and Dedicate Frostpine. Not only are Smithmages immune to normal fire and being pierced by nonmagical metal, they can craft supernaturally sharp blades, future scrying mirrors, and any number of charms from engraved metal or twisted wire.


-Blessing of Dundr (The Banner Saga) (400CP)
        You received the blessing of Dundr as he left the world, and received the boon of the god of smithing and knowledge. You gain godly talent in learning how to smith and can weave stories that capture and entertain people on equal footing of the greatest bards.


-Hammer And Forge (Legend of Zelda Breath Of The Wild - TG) (400CP)
        A personal smithy that you can deploy anywhere, the equipment and fires here are in the best possible condition for truly creating great works of blacksmithing art. Any materials needed to be expended in making these weapons and armor will be replenished, unless they're explicitly supernatural. As a bonus, you'll find that as long as you hang up your shingle, it'll be much easier to find warriors who can make the most of the equipment you craft!


-Incredibly Talented: Blacksmithing (In Another World With My Smartphone) (400CP)
        There is one area in which you truly shine. Pick a single skill or talent such as hand to hand, swordsmanship, magical innovation, alchemy, or similar focus. You are now, hands down, one of the best people in the world in that subject.
        An alchemist could come up with all sorts of new alchemical concoctions and potions that would astound and amaze your peers, a swordsman could cut down a hundred men on his own nearly effortlessly, a magical innovator could create new spells or rituals or magical items with unsurpassed vision and creativity, and similar such potency applies to any other skill or focus you take with this perk.
        Beyond that however you will always be able to refine your focus, allowing you to push yourself to greater and greater heights no matter how skilled you become. You may purchase this perk more than one, but it must apply to a new skill or focus each time it is taken.
-Moonsilver Smith (World of Darkness - Werewolf the Apocalypse) (400CP)
        Not only have you been trained by some of your tribe's best silversmiths you have a talent for crafting silver that goes beyond mere mortal. Not only is it easier to talk a spirit into inhabiting your creations, any silver weapon you create never dulls or breaks in battle. They also deal twice the damage to any creature vulnerable to silver. Outside of this jump, supernatural creatures that take damage from your silver weapons are wounded as if they are vulnerable to silver.


-Swordsmith (Fate/Legends Japan Land of the Rising Sun) (400CP)
        What else shows the spirit of the Japanese but the famed katana blade? Such a central part of their mythos as to have the most famous craftsmen become like heroes themselves. No matter how great, they do not remember the makers of armor or shields like they do artisans of the blade. On the level of legends like Masamune and Muramasa, you are one of these legendary swordsmiths. Even in an ordinary forge with ordinary metals, you can smith katana of a supernatural quality. Edges that split magical steel and blades that don't shatter after a thousand strikes on rock. Often, these even have magical effects if you intend them, such as sharpening as they drink more blood or cutting at a much greater distance than just the physical blade. Should you have access to tools, materials and even magic of a greater level, you will be able to create far greater weapons. Weapons that bring ruin to armies, that cut castles in two with a single slash, fiery tools that send billowing tides of flame to swallow whole forests. When truly inspired, you can even create things on a divine level, the stuff of legends that only a divinity could normally craft. A sword that splits the fabric of reality itself in two, perhaps. With time, your talents may be able to be applied to any form of blade, not just Japanese swords. Should you gain magic of your own, you will see that imbuing those effects into your weapons is effortless, even magnifying the potency of your spells greatly beyond what you would normally be able to cast if you place them into the form of a sword.


-The Earth Forge (Elder Scrolls Online) (400CP)
        Or rather a replica of it, attached to your warehouse or slotting into the world in the location of your choosing at the start of each jump. The Earth Forge is as much a fortress as it is a workshop, hidden far away prying eyes and located deep underground, its entrance guarded by a small fort carved out in ancient times. The Forge itself is located deep underground, only accessible by following a tunnel that can easily be used as a chokepoint to bottleneck an invading army or fortified into a near- impenetrable hall of traps and sealed dwemer-metal blast doors. It's real value however, is the smithy itself. Using flame salts (which never seem to run low), raw magma (which never seems to burn or cause heatstroke unless you physically leap into it) and a massive blast furnace (which never breaks or needs refueling) in addition to its magical nature and tools surpassing what even the Grand-Masters of Tamriel could hope to lay their hands on, the Earth Forge is quite possibly one of, if not the, greatest smith's workshops on Nirn, equaled perhaps only by the yet-undiscovered Aetherium Forge and the factories of Sotha Sil the Clockwork King. Comes with a small retinue of NPC guards to... well... guard it.


-Flesh and Steel (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - TG) (600CP)
        Clothes can make the man, you've learned. It might be possible for someone to perform great feats of stealth in bulky plate, but even someone with that kind of skill would be much better served with the appropriate wear, right? And the tales of those with shining and enchanted armor allowing the hero to survive impossible odds are common - the hammer that could forge such a thing is now in your hands. With this skill, you can create armor and accessories(such as rings, jewelry, and armbands) that directly imbue the wearer with supernatural power, physical boosts, and prowess in certain skills. With this, you could create amber earrings that make one tougher, or a suit of armor that allows you to swim faster! In addition, if you have Hammer and Anvil, Gimmick and Trick and Fire and Ice - your weapon crafting skill is among the legendary smiths of old, able to create the kind of weapons only worthy of the 4 Champions of Hyrule itself, matching the mythic weapons of Hyrule such as the sword of Biggoron or the Six Sages!


-Forge and Ore (Silmarillion) (600CP)
        The Dwarves are known for their crafting above all things. To craft the proper equipment takes a fine forge and proper raw materials. You now have your own forge fully equipped for forging any item of metal. Attached to the grand forge is a cave filled with much of the most common ores and even a bit of mithril. In future jumps ores of materials in that setting will begin to appear deeper in the cave. The rarer the metal the less of it there will be. The forge and cave may be attached to your warehouse or another property you own.


-Forgemaster (Marvel Magic) (600CP)
        You are skilled in the art of the forge. You craft weapons and shape armor in the way a master artist plies their trade. Perhaps you trained with a god of the forge or studied under the dwarves of Nidavellir or maybe you've simply honed your skills over lifetime's. Whatever the case, your skill with the forge goes beyond what normal mortals would be able to accomplish. You have the skill to work with metals; though perhaps not the natural hardiness required to survive the conditions needed to forge them. And even were you to only have sub-par mundane materials, you could still craft weapons and armor fit for any king who has ever lived. Further, if you know how to utilize the mystic arts, you will find yourself talented at enchanting your creations with your spells and perhaps you will even be able to forge great and powerful artifacts. But the modern world has largely moved beyond the crude weapons of old and if you wish, you may do so as well. With some effort you would be able to transfer your skills to more advanced components, creating powerful firearms or masterful mechanical vehicles.


-Master Smith | Ahzidal's Apprentice (Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB) (800CP)
        Master Smith (400CP)
        So, how many iron daggers did this take to get? Regardless of the answer to that question the results have surely shown themselves to you and everyone else. You're a master of smithing and the working of metal, forging weapons out of Glass and Ebony is well within your capacity, and even Daedric items may be forged with proper equipment and materials. Your craftsmanship is nothing less than perfection and your opportunity to grow is great as well. Given times you may yet forge tools, weapons and armor that rival even the likes of Daedric artifacts.
        Ahzidal's Apprentice (400CP)
        The art of spellcasting has more to it than just flinging fireballs and screaming about UNLIMITED POWER as one electrocutes their enemies. The arts of Enchantment and Alteration stand as testaments to this fact, enchantment in particular stands as a powerful, yet indirect system of magic and when it comes to this branch and the operation of it only the Dragon Priest Ahzidal is your equal. Like him you've collected vast knowledge pertaining to the various magical bases of the Mer, whether it be the ancient runes of the Ayleids or the process of harmonizing the seven natures of metal. This craft extends far and wide and with it even a mere band of 500 warriors could be given equipment powerful enough to fell a powerful race of spellcasters like the Falmer, or in other, more simple words your enchantments are legendary. You could perhaps go even further, runes are simply another language, and if understanding them allows you to use them, then perhaps even others like that of the Dovah might be as well.
        This is lore based Daedric artifacts which includes shit like instant kill weapons or key that can conceptually unlock anything. Or a sword that stole power from a daedra and flew a floating city of soul warriors into mundus. Pretty much all major Daedric artifacts are conceptual even if they are nerfed for the game.


-Divine-Smith/S Rank | Falna (Danmachi) (1000CP)
        Divine-Smith/S Rank (1000CP)
        Unlike the original Blacksmith this version grants you the ability to add multiple magical abilities and powers that you have access to in your creations along with infinite usage of this magical abilities and powers. At max rank it would allow you to create a divine item and add a maximum of twelve magical abilities and powers that has greater power, utility and effectiveness compared to the magic swords of this world.
        Falna (0CP)
        The blessings of a god or goddess are given to you. Your abilities, as well as any skills you develop, are portrayed upon your back and your God/Goddess can update them for you. Each level up potentially allows you to gain a developmental ability and gain skills every time you gain a new greater goal, realization, enlightenment or conviction allowing you to potentially gain new skills based on those. For 300cp would upgrade the Falna that you received that guarantees that you would gain a developmental ability and skill every time you level up and after this jump the perks, abilities and skills that you gained from the past to the future would be translated and displayed into a skill, magic and developmental ability that you can improve along with the Falna automatically updates periodically. You can also view your Falna in your mind or let others see your back to view your status along with it automatically integrating any existing System that you have access gained all of the advantages and discarding as much weakness and drawbacks as possible. The one that would give you the Falna is the God/Goddess of the Familia that you choose in the Familia Section and if you are a God/Goddess you can give yourself a Falna even if it's not possible in cannon or the companion that took the God/Goddess Origin. After this jump you are given an option on either retaining this System or not and if you choose to abandon this System all the developmental ability, magic and skills that you have would become a perk allowing you to use them without the assistance of the Falna.




 --- Domain: Crafting: Technological (29) (33 Perks) --- 




-Bandit Gunsmith (Borderlands) (100CP)
        You have amazing technical insight and when shown a pile of broken weapons or energy shields you can use parts from some to reassemble others into decent condition. Don't expect it to be pretty, but you can nail 15 repeater pistols together to make a functional shotgun, or use bits of five shields to make one that works.


-Big Bada-Boom (Azeroth) (100CP)
        You may not make the prettiest of engineering gizmos, but boy do you know how to make them go BOOM! You can make big bombs or little bombs or big bombs IN little bombs capable of taking out an entire skyscraper. You are an expert at bomb crafting, able to make bombs the size of a marble that would make even Deathwing flinch. This also extends to defusing bombs if, for some reason, you don't want a boom, but that's just crazy talk.


-Hammer Jammer (MtG - Bablovia) (100CP)
        Sometimes, all you need is a hammer. You've become insanely good at all sorts of Do-it-Yourself work and inventing gadgets, even with unusual parts. They might seem crude and useless from the outside, but the contraptions you invent do their job just fine. You also become good at repairing things, there's nothing you and your hammer can't fix.


-Laboratory Work (IOU) (100CP)
        Given a few hours and suitable tools you can almost always come up with a set of disposable tools that will counter a given gadget or ability you've encountered in the past. It'll only work once or twice, but with good sense that might be all you need.


-Tool King (Modded Fallout) (100CP)
        Starting with a cartload of random junk and ending with high-quality ammunition or power cells, cutting-edge improvements to power armor, overcharged laser weaponry or even entirely new kinds of science is practically trivial for the average Fallout protagonist yet their talents pale compared to yours. This Perk grants you immediate access to pretty much any kind of crafting shown in the Fallout series: from Hand Loader to Science! and Chemist to Robotics Expert, if it somehow involves building things out of other things (from guns to ammo to even entire buildings), you've got it - including perfectly memorized designs for the kind of components and tools you might need, like the Robotics Workbench or Nuka-Cola Mixer station. In fact, you're good enough that you'll never make mistakes while doing this type of crafting (assuming someone doesn't start shooting at you or some such), and you'll be perfectly aware of where you were in the process if you do find yourself interrupted and have to continue later on.


-Enhanced I.C. Chip (Mega Man Classic) (200CP)
        You know how to create stronger I.C. chip, these chips from the core of a robots personality, it's memory and the likes. Stronger chips are less fragile and less susceptible to reprogramming. Any sapient machine you make will retain their own personality, even though virus attacks and so long as the chip remains intact, they can outlive their body.


-Fingers of the North Star (Cave Story) (200CP)
        You have a natural talent with machinery, and this extends to firearms creation. You can disassemble, analyze, and reassemble any projectile weapon you come across, and you have the ability to create unique, one of a kind guns that utilizes odd and esoteric technology. You also gain a free 'stamp' you can apply to any weapon you create, to show it's your work. Upgrading existing weapons is a breeze as well.


-Legendary Craftsman (Modded Fallout) (200CP)
        Remember all those unique prototype weapons with crazy awesome effects? The Legendary items in Fallout 4? The games have had their fair share of 'better than normal' items, and you know just how to make them. You have the ability to substantially improve whatever items you work on, needing at most enough components to build a second copy of the item in question. Whether it's dumping half your power cell into each shot a la Pew-Pew, making every bullet fired by your Minigun into an explosive round, or crafting armor that boosts your stats with no regard for how or why it works, you've got it all. Never again will you need to worry about being unable to find that Two-Shot or Instigating Gauss Rifle! You'll even be able to (slightly) fudge where those unique effects could be found, like making Power Armor with special effects or a Gatling Laser that does fire explosive rounds. Beams. Whatever.


-Maliwan Intern (Borderlands) (200CP)
        At some point, you got lucky and figured out how Elemental Weapons really work. You know how to use them to best effect, allowing you to set enemies on fire regularly, melt people with acid bullets, and have ALL kinds of shocking adventures with electrical ammo. If you have any technical training, you can even jury-rig ways to apply elemental effects to other weapons, as well.


-The Love of Lightning (Fate/Grand Order) (200CP)
        Steam Power! Coal! Electricity! The Nuclear Age! All the greatest revolutionaries have brought new power with them, their obsessions letting them take great bounds over the opposition to advance all of humanity. You share that same potential with one form of technological power, greatly advancing your skill and potential when dealing with technology that uses it. It could be electricity powered tech, steam powered tech or even wind powered tech. Whatever you choose, you'll be able to make them much stronger, much more efficient and much cheaper than you normally could. Not all energies are exactly equal however, so you may still find yourself needing more resources than normal, though you'd still get the increased power and efficiency.


-Weapon crafting (Devil May Cry) (200CP)
        Alright, so you fancy yourself a weapons dealer, huh? Well now you know the ins and outs of every single tool made for killing that you get your crafty little hands on. Swords, handguns, axes, sniper rifles, spears, rocket launchers, it'll all come naturally to you, and you will be able to create these weapons or even improve them with your own custom designs. And to make it even a better deal, you know how to modify a weapon to have unlimited ammunition capability. So go nuts, buddy. You've earned it.


-Gadgeteer (Young Justice) (300CP)
        An inventive mind and the know how to make gadgets; though they can't do anything too outside of normal physics, you are perfectly capable of making functional things like grappling hooks, tracking devices, boomerangs that automatically return to you, and trick arrows. In addition to being very cheap to make, any gadgets that you have are almost as intuitive to use as your very limbs, allowing you to use and switch between them easily and without hassle.


-High-Frequency Manufacturer (Metal Gear Rising) (300CP)
        A blade launderer, huh? Anyway, you can now make a HF blade out of anything you want. Depending on the original craftsmanship of the weapon, it could be good or shit. But if you picked this, you probably have something in mind. Must be a physical object. No lightsabers and the like. Yes, blunt objects can become HF weapons. No, they can't cut. They only get stronger, and can resist other HF weapons.


-I Can Fix It! (Reborn) (300CP)
        Technology is a wonderful thing, and you discovered that long ago. You have a knack for Flame rings and machines of all kinds, and can fix or maintain most machines. You can even improve them to beyond their normal specs. Comes with its own toolbox.


-Mechanist (Fallout 4) (300CP)
        You know what makes robots tick or beep. Not only can you repair and create them from scratch, but you can also cobble them together, creating some sort of robotic Frankenstein's Monster that's loyal to you and you alone while also incorporating all of the best components of the robots it's made.


-Clockwork Artist (Hellboy) (400CP)
        Kroenen is said to have created a clockwork bird capable of singing Mozart in his earlier days, though the assassin's love of music is less well known than the fear he inspired later in life. He is now more well known for his other clockwork inventions- namely his hand, and the clockwork mechanisms spread throughout his body that when wound up give the man his deadly strength, speed, and reflexes. You are capable of creating similar mechanical inventions, though you may lack the ability to self-modify to his extent without his love of pain and lack of blood.


-Game-breaking Union (Modded Fallout) (400CP)
        Mods are such funny things, change a few numbers here, tweak a few values there, and before you know it you've got miniguns that fire low-yield nukes and other such madness. Well, mad you may be, but it's certainly not weak. You have the strange and imposing ability to make modifications to your gear in ways that well, really shouldn't be. You're still limited to what you'd normally be able to build, but any kind of sensible limits on what kind of item the upgrades apply to goes right out the window. Attach jetpacks to your helmet, fire .308 cal armor-piercing rounds from a lightweight SMG with no penalties to its performance, and yes - install a MIRV Fat Man mod onto your Minigun and (somehow) blanket the world in nuclear annihilation at a rate of about thirty mushroom clouds per second or so. Might wanna put that Power Armor plating in your underwear first though


-Gimme a Tic (Gonna be the Twin-Tail) (400CP)
        They ain't never seen an engineer like yourself. You're not just able to keep up with some of the best and brightest in this world, such as creating teleporters that can be carried in your palm or energy shields that can offset a rocket launcher yet are contained within small pieces of jewellery, but you are also able to outright make what you design too. You work fast and hard, enough to do the work of dozens of skilled men working constantly over weeks of time in just a single night. You could construct a fully outfitted underground base beneath a house, excavating and manufacturing and coding all the gadgets and rooms and devices needed, within a single night and not leave anyone above ground aware of it.


-Industrialization (GURPS Technomancer) (400CP)
        Ah, mass production. Where would the world be without it? Nowhere special! Fortunately, you can spread this art with ease, even to things that most wouldn't expect it'd apply to! By gathering a few people capable of producing something, you can form them into a proper production line, no matter how special that item might normally be! What ONE ring? These amazing rings of invisibility are now being mass produced! Get yours now!


-Mark Whatever (Satisfactorio-Satisfactory Factorio Gauntlet) (400CP)
        You want to make a Mark 7 belt? Sure thing. You can create improved versions of your technology just by adding rarer and/or more processed materials to the recipe. These will not be as materially efficient as more of the lower-mark technology, but will be more efficient in other ways, including space or energy-per-effect.


-Mechanic (Smash Up) (400CP)
        You can fix anything. Quite literally. Alien technology, magical artifacts. You may not even understand what they do or how they work, but you can see when they're broken and how to fix it.


-Retrofit+ (Azur Lane) (400CP)
        Let's face it, some Ship-girls are a little out of date when it comes to the tech department. That's what your standard retrofit is for, getting that old girl caught up with her peers. But, of course, this is a Perk, and nothing standard about it. By buying this Perk, you effectively un-cap all of your Ship-girls in terms of abilities. And you can keep retrofitting them, over and over, ad infinitum. Of course, it gets more expensive and the materials get more esoteric each time, but, it's a labor of love, right? As a bonus, along with the boosts to power, you might find that your Ship-girl starts to radically shift in physical appearance towards your tastes. Maybe that loli Destroyer will grow up, if you want her to. Or maybe you'll find Tennessee becoming softer and more cuddly as the successive Retrofits pile up. As long as you want it, it'll happen. Post-Jump you can do this to anyone, not just your Ship-girls, but you will still need reagents that fit with your target.


-Seamless Construction (Endless Space) (400CP)
        You might not be able to design the perfect ship, but you certainly could build one that is good enough. Given enough resources and the proper blueprints, you can build ships that would rival that of the Endless, cast as a single, cohesive whole. Even if you build it with mundane methods, it still ends up being nearly perfect, not a single design flaw or construction error in sight. This also applies to things you build that aren't spaceships.


-Super-Max (Generic City of Adventure) (400CP)
        There's not a single revolving door or scrap of cardboard in the defences you construct. Prisons, team headquarters, space outposts...wherever they are, whatever they're for, you can seamlessly integrate magical or super-tech materials into architecture without compromising function, style or habitability. Marble flooring pressure plates? Electronics mixed with clockwork backups to stymie technopaths? Getting the right mix of anti-demon salt mixed with cement to both look good and still keep them out? Easy. Of course, this perk includes enough architectural skill and artistic flair to make your own jumper-buildings look good, even with a giant glowing insignia on one side.


-Traps and Gizmos (Kingdom Hearts) (400CP)
        What do an ice cream machine, a present wrapping contraption, and a pair of gloves have in common? They're all powerful weapons! That is to say, with a bit of elbow grease and this perk you can make them into weapons. Not only can you weaponize rather unusual things, you also excel at creating traps and robots to ensure riff-raff leave you, your store, and your customers alone. You could make electrically charged gauntlets, toy dispensers that can take out Heartless, and candy makers that launch their delicious payload with enough force to knock grown men around.


-You Became A Star (Robot Unicorn Attack Gauntlet) (400CP)
        You've gained insight into the process of using rainbows to harness Unicornium without having it explode in your face. With it, you can build your own robot unicorns or other rainbow creatures. Once your initial adventure here concludes successfully you will be taught by an expert wishsmith on everything you might need to know to construct Wishes and design your own upgrades for them.


-Centurio Ordinatus (Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus) (600CP)
        You have been inducted into the Divisio Militarus, a branch of the adeptus mechanicus dedicated to the construction and operation of the Ordinatus war machines, mighty titan-scale siege weapons of unparalleled power. While the shielding and mobility systems that carry these devices into battle are relatively simple to create, you understand the intricacies of how physics and performance are affected by up-sizing technology. With sufficient data on the function of a humble lasgun or arc rifle to extrapolate from, you could smoothly transition that device to function when a hundred or more times larger - and to be appropriately more powerful than the simple multiplication of its output would suggest. The weapons you create and oversee are fit for a god-machine to wield, and the likes of Nova Cannons and weapons arrays on board the largest ships of the Mechanicus are also within your purview.


-Gadgeteer (DC Arrowverse) (600CP)
        The world is a dangerous place, with supervillains and rogue metahumans. This is why you have science to help things out. You're able to make stuff that runs on comic book science. Be it shrinking technology, or a cold gun that fires just a few degrees above Absolute Zero. As long as you have the resources available and a working concept in your head the sky's the limit. Doesn't mean you'll get it right the first time around.


-Gadgeteer (GURPS Monster Hunters) (600CP)
        The supernatural? Unscientific? HAH! Monsters and magic are some of the most scientific things out there! Why, with just a bit of effort and some analysis, you can easily tinker up interesting new things from the corpse of a monster, or a countermeasure to a spell, or a device that negates psychic powers! A cord might prevent ghosts from crossing, a flashlight might have a portable fusion reactor to burn vampires, and your gun might auto-plate it's bullets with silver, and you're the one who makes and maintains it all!


-Lightning is my Art (Van Helsing) (600CP)
        You have twisted Tesla's theorems, plans, and experiments to whole new levels, creating tools and gadgetry capable of warping lightning and electricity to ends unseen by the man himself. You can give life to stitched-together golems and clockwork automatons with your tools, use electricity to manipulate, warp, or fracture objects to your individual needs, and even twist people into your warped, hunchbacked goons with your favorite flavor of electroshock therapy. Any technology made by you can run off of any electrical source you have access to (and is, in-fact, empowered for it), and has a Gothic London theme to it on a completely unrelated note.


-Perversions of the Natural Order (The Glass Scientists) (600CP)
        The laws of physics get very flexible when you're doing engineering. Usually in ways that benefit you. Conductors conduct slightly better, resistors are a little more resistant. As your projects grow in scale, so does this effect. You may even build mecha that ignore square-cube law. With enough time and resources, who knows? Reality can be whatever you want.


-The Laws are Mine (Van Helsing) (600CP)
        The laws of such trivial things as physics, biology, chemistry, really any sort of recognized science are mere guidelines to you. You can break an established rule of scientific nature so long as it supports your goals and abilities. Anything from conservation of energy, to the conservation of matter, to the second law of thermodynamics in that entropy increases over time. Just... still... try not dividing by zero. I can't trust what will happen.


-Tinker Plus (Generic Worm Fanfiction) (800CP)
        You're not just a Tinker anymore, you're the Tinker. The PRT rating scale isn't really set up to handle someone like you because it assumes that Tinkers will have specialties, and you don't. You are something never seen before; a genuine omni-Tinker, and one of truly amazing capacity.
        Your aptitude and intuition for all sorts of research, science, engineering, and design is absolutely unbelievable. If a project is even halfway related to any of the hard sciences then you can get it done, and do so with a speed and efficiency that makes even experienced Tinkers working within their own specialities look like clumsy beginners. And you can rapidly reverse-engineer other technology given sufficient opportunity to study it, however complex or esoteric it might be. You can even study and analyze exotic and anomalous phenomena, such as cape powers in action, to hopefully gain inspiration for new Tinkertech.
        You have a volume knob in your head for making your designs either easily reproducible by mundane methods or totally blackboxed vs. any reverse-engineering or anything in between. You can perform what would have required clean room levels of precision assembly for mundane engineers with ordinary tools and under rough conditions. Troubleshooting or repairing tech that you already understand is a job you could practically do in your sleep, and anything you build or overhaul is maintenance-optional. With time and practice your Tinker abilities can improve and grow indefinitely, without any upper limit.
        You can't do things like 'perfected social sciences' or 'auto-win personal interaction methodologies', though. That sort of thing is for Thinkers, not Tinkers.


 --- Domain: Crafting: Magical Items (30) (72 Perks) --- 


-Cult of the Gun (Enter the Gungeon) (100CP)
        What makes The Gungeon work? Magic. Duh. But, it's a specific type of magic: Gun magic, magic that makes objects more gun-like, or that accentuates the gun-like traits of non-gun objects. Unrestrained, it can turn a gun-like non-gun object, like a mailbox, into a gun, granting it a projectile and a firing method. The Gungeon does this passively, but you know how to direct this ability and use it to your advantage, taking any kind of object, and making it into a "gun," complete with the same perks that any gun-like object might gain. It's still fairly uncontrolled, with little if any say on your part as to what kind of weapon you get. How else do you explain, "guns," like a mailbox that fires letters and packages; a banana that fires explosive bananas; a bee hive that fires bees(duh); a camera that deals room-wide damage, knockback, and slowing; a guzheng that fires arrows when played; a pillow that fires zippers and stuns nearby enemies when reloaded; a crate that fires anvils; or a compressed air tank that fires homing sharks?
-Magic Charms (Touhou Forbidden Hermit) (100CP)
You can make ofuda with a variety of uses – sealing creatures away or just hurting youkai in general. Sealing ofuda can hold someone paralyzed in place or lock away spirits harmlessly inside inanimate objects. Ones designed to hurt youkai will sting quite a great deal and potentially destroy them with repeated applications. Though for all their utility, they’re still pieces of paper, and while creatures cannot normally damage ofuda that affect them unless they are very strong, ofuda are noticeably weak to wind and rain. In time you may learn how to craft others based off myths about shrine maidens.


-Amulet Crafting (World of Darkness - Mummy the Resurrection) (200CP)
        Amulets, a more permanent form of magic, can also be enchanted by Mummies. Amulets can take many forms, from small pieces of jewelry to strips of paper. Making an amulet is a lengthy and expensive process, requiring much magical energy. Amulets can be crafted to ward against specific forms of damage, to improve one's attributes, or grant unique abilities such as cloud walking or invisibility.


-Artificer (Masters of Magic) (200CP)
        You begin the game already knowing the magics to create enchanted items (other wizards can eventually acquire them) and artifacts. Additionally, these items cost half as much for you to make, and take half the time. This allows you to equip heroes you hire in the early game. In future jumps, this will provide a slight boost to the creation time and a reduction to the creation cost of magical items.


-Eight-Fold Geomantic Mastery (Generic Exalted) (200CP)
        You possess the inherent understanding and skill with geomancy and the manipulation of natural energies such that you may now create manses in any area where such a thing could conceivably be created. The stronger the mystic or magical significance of a given place the more powerful the manse that can be built there, but even in the barest and most mystically barren areas you will still be capable of producing, given some time, a manse of the least (1-dot) power. The process of creating a Manse is tremendously faster for you than it would be for others, the necessary geomantic arrays and arrangements seeming to simply leap to your mind with a clarity of insight few if any could match. The Eight-Fold part of it is that you understand the methods for creating manses aspected towards all five of the elemental essences of fire, earth, wind, water, and wood as well as manses aspected towards solar, lunar, and stellar (sidereal) energies. Given time and effort you may discern methods for creating other types of manse, twisted mockeries of what nature intended, but such insights will take considerable effort, time, and resources to bear fruit. Taking this perk explicitly allows you to create manses even outside of Creation and, indeed, is the only way to create manses outside of Creation.


-Formations and Forging (World of Cultivation) (200CP)
        The basics of forging a new talisman lies in formations, by taking rare and powerful reagents and materials you can create powerful talismans to focus your power and grant you certain abilities. In its simplest form you could create such simple talismans as the earth turning hoe that ling farmers often purchase to help in their farming, while the highest levels are often dependent on the amount of time and the materials used by the forge. Such things as the earth turning sealing disc that creates the pressure of a thousand catties (1300 pounds) worth of weight upon another person for each spin of it, or the turtle style buddha ring formation which can protect an island from foes can be created. Many types of seal techniques are open to you now, it wall depends on what you are willing to do to master them.


-Grudge Forged (Fate/Legends Japan Land of the Rising Sun) (200CP)
        Ibaraki-douji created her favoured bone sword by tearing out the bones of many Oni and setting them into a forge of her own terrible flames for hundreds of days. A way of sword smithing only a demon could manage, a brutal and unrefined method that results in a brutal and unrefined sword. But that sword is powerful, near unbreakable and holds the furious grudges of the Oni sacrificed to make it, giving the weapon a deadly cursed aura. This sort of feat is much more applicable to your skills now, as you find it far easier to turn your own innate abilities to the work of crafting things. A dragon's fire improves the quality of things forged in it, rather than just destroying the entire workshop. Cooling a forged sword in your own Youkai poison will still cool it as if with water but also imbue powerful toxins into the metal itself. You are able to add your abilities in creative ways to your creations without compromising them. Better still, you're very good at focusing what you create to not harm yourself. Using the bones of hundreds of hate-filled demons to create a cursed sword would direct those curses at your enemies, not at the original wielder of the sword. No need to worry about life draining demon blades if you're at the source of them all.


-Innate Talent: Magic item creator (Overlord - The Series) (200CP)
        You possess the good fortune to have an Innate Talent. Innate Talents are abilities that people are born with, and usually only one in two hundred people will actually have one. They can run the gamut of all sorts of things, though there is no certainty people will be born with an ability they will actually be able to make use of. For example someone born with an innate talent for learning magic doesn't actually help them find a magic teacher, and thus some innate talents may go to waste. Thankfully for you you can choose what Innate Talent you have from the following list. You possess the unheard of ability to have more than one Innate Talent, assuming you purchase more than one.
        You're really, unnaturally, good at making magic items. If you know how to make something then you can make it magical. Spoons, bowls, armor, books, weapons, toasters, anything. You actually have to know some magic in order to enchant items with a magical effect, and you don't gain any skills in actually making items, so if you want to make magic swords you'll have to learn some magic and then how to make regular swords first. You can copy down into scrolls any spell you know, which others can use to learn those spells (if they are capable of using that magic system and put in the time to study) or use them as one-use magic items. Additionally any magic item you create will be marginally better than it would have otherwise been, regardless of whatever abilities you might have brought with you from other worlds. You don't have to have this talent to make magic items or spell scrolls, but someone that does have this talent will always be much better than someone that doesn't.


-Magical Books (Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB) (200CP)
        The art of spellcraft is one that requires an immense amount of dedication and in many ways talent as well. Learning new spells can take ages and this can easily drive many off or act as a massive constraint when time is of the essence. You've found a bit of a way around this conundrum, by imbuing a simple book with your understanding of the spellcraft you can create a magical item that when activated immediately passes this onto whoever activated it, though the book is consumed in the process. While this only applies to Elder Scrolls magic at first, you'll find that adapting it to other systems is an easy process and only requires that the process be fine tuned.


-Orb Alchemist (Timespinner) (200CP)
        The use of Aura is a key part of Viletean culture, and Orbs are an important tool in that regard. They act as focuses for Aura, allowing for standard and empowered effects, compared to what someone could accomplish on their own. You have the knowledge and skills to be able to craft these Orbs, or similar magical focuses. It will generally take materials such as gold, silver, gemstones, or other magically conductive materials. You can also improve these orbs using bits of crystallized Aura in the form of elemental beads, or using similar materials you can discover in future Jumps.


-Origami Witch (Fate/Legends Japan Land of the Rising Sun) (200CP)
        A simple art turned deadly in your hands. Years of experience in folding paper has certainly made you a master at creating even the most complex origami shapes, your skill growing to the point that it began to mix with your magical energy, turning into something much more dangerous. You can easily use magic to shape paper into a wide variety of forms, imbued with varying effects. Creating origami familiars from paper, dangerous enough to scythe through human soldiers, is a ground-level effect. Creating powerful shields from overlapping paper flowers, flight through origami wings, patterns that strengthen existing spells or apply curse-like debuffs to those pierced by the paper cranes are all possible. While your main skill lies with direct paper spells, you will also find it much more possible to place magical effects onto paper for use with your magic. Researching some form of Onmyoudo or runic spells could prove especially potent.


-Photomirroring (Duel Monsters - Duel Terminal Part 2) (200CP)
        Every Gishki wields their own Aquamirror. But these artifacts are mere replicas of the true Aquamirror, much weaker and limited than the original, even if they still function as potent foci for ritual magics. While the true Aquamirror still eludes you, you've become an accomplished crafter, and can easily replicate all sorts of magical artifacts in much weaker forms. I wouldn't be surprised if a portion of the Gishki currently active are actually wielding copies made by you instead of Noellia. Still, it's gonna take a lot more than this to improve on your copied designs, or even just make them easier to wield.


-Relay Artisan (Age of Wonders ll) (200CP)
        The knowledge necessary to create the massive structures known as 'Wizard Towers' is not easy to learn, but not especially rare either. Indeed, all Wizards rely on these towers for their abilities - in particular the ability to vastly increase the reach of their magics by channeling their arcane power through gigantic crystalline projectors lining the tower's structure. Smaller, less powerful crystals are occasionally used as well, both as 'Magic Relay' structures at fixed locations and with special equipment used by champions of the various armies. You are a gifted artificer when it comes to creating such relays and projectors. Not only can you create such crystals, but you have mastered the magical theories behind their function to the point you could craft these magical artifacts from other materials such as wood or silver. As your skill increases you'll be able to create more intricate and efficient relays, reducing their size or increasing their range. With practice, you could craft gemstones small enough for a ring's jewel that could let you project your magic within a dozen miles of their location. Once attuned, the connection between a Wizard and the relays you craft cannot be broken, it will continue to function across any distance and even across dimensions so long as the relay remains intact.


-Relic Magic (World of Darkness - Mummy the Resurrection) (200CP)
        Much like amulets, relics are permanent objects that can be imbued with mystical effects. Unlike amulets, relics can be magical automatons or objects crafted to follow a soul into the underworld. Any relic crafted is bound to a single person when crafted and only functions for them. Relics can be as simple as a small model of a house that exists in full size within the underworld, small animated statues, or as complex as large guards and soldiers carved of stone, or even a special statue designed to allow a Mummy in the underworld to inhabit and interact with the living world.


-Rune Carving (Warhammer Fantasy - Tomb Kings) (200CP)
        Necrotects themselves are usually inexperienced in the ways of magic. It's rarely their duty to cast spells or command rituals, yet they are often called upon to inscribe runes on a vast scale or otherwise prepare things for magical means. You're very skilled at creating structures or items that can be channelled or used with magic, even whilst lacking it yourself. If you had a mage or wizard on hand, you'd even be able to work in tandem effortlessly, crafting items or structures suited to that person's magic in particular, working even better for them than anyone else.


-Soul Shards (Minecraft) (200CP)
        You know the dark arts needed to create a Soul Shard, which will eagerly devour the souls of those you slay. With enough of the souls of a given kind of creature, you'll be able to set up a Monster Spawner, which can release these souls as an endless wave of hostile creatures, ready to be slain and harvested (or perhaps unleashed upon your enemies). Alternatively, you might employ the Soul Forge to use these souls to create sinister Corrupted Iron, used to create foul equipment empowered by those you've slain.


-Wandmaker (Starbound) (200CP)
        There is more to life than just technology. You have mastered the mysterious process of binding elemental phenomena to seemingly harmless wands and staves, allowing those that use them to summon up fire or ice or acid or other stranger effects. With practice, the power of the effects your wands and staves can create will grow, and you could even manage to bind multiple effects to a single weapon.


-Artifice (Avernum) (300CP)
        You have a gift for the creation of powerful magical items. As True Artifacts their magic won't ever run out, or at the very least won't run out for a very long time. What you can make is limited to your knowledge, your imagination, and your resources.


-Crafting (Geneforge) (300CP)
        There are various things that can only be created through the use of essence and hard work. Shaped equipment, puresteel, certain complicated tools and devices, and certain materials used in enchanting. You can work all of them, producing high quality goods from basic ore and hard work.


-Key of Artifice | Grand Artificer (Lords of the Night Liches) (300CP)
        Key of Artifice (200CP)
        Upon buying this perk you gain access to the first level of the Arcana of Artifice, and will naturally deepen your understanding and power in it over time with no more personal investment in that growth. The Key of Artifice allows liches who practice it to form a sort of reserve of artifice energy inside themselves that they can invest into items to create various Arcane tools. The amount of energy they can invest grows with each rank, but is fixed. They must recover the invested Artifice energy if they want to reinvest it in a new item. Normally it's somewhat annoying to reclaim energy from an item you don't have control of, but because you bought it as a perk, you may freely reclaim it at any time. Actually investing Artifice energy requires enchantment work and spending three parts Arcane energy for every bit of Artifice invested. A lich gains the ability to make items in this order -
        Arcane Focus: An Arcane Focus can have a number of abilities depending on the amount of Artifice invested in it, and how those points are invested. Only the Lich who makes it can use it. It can store Arcane, though it's not as efficient as an Arcane Crystal. It can be made to regenerate Arcane on its own for a somewhat high cost in Artifice. It can be made into a tool that can hold spells for you. It can make your spells deal greater damage. It can make it easier to use Sorcerae. It can help maintain Arcana for you with a phantom mind. It can help protect you from the threat of insanity from overusing Arcana - though unless you take certain disadvantages, you're already protected. It can have any other reasonable power that is in line with these.
        Arcane Crystal: These crystals can hold Arcane Energy, and are easy to move energy into and out of. No other function, but they are more cost effective for the amount stored then a Focus. They're made from precious gems, with the more precious the gem, the better a focus it can make. A simple one is in the 10 gp range, while the greatest ones are crystals worth 500 gp. Since you purchased this perk, it's possible for you to potentially use exotic / rarer / more expensive gems, but such would require research on your part.
        Occularum: An Occularum is a kind of immaterial drone used as a spy or seeker. Appearing as inky globes of misty darkness about two feet across, their shape seems to hint at being a giant eye. They usually remain on the Spectral Plane, only called when needed. Even when called forth, they are immaterial presences, hiding in the folds between the Material and the Spectral plane. Made of the substance of thought and imagination, they can slip through the tiniest crack even in substances that can block the immaterial. They can't really be damaged, though they can be stopped by forces that guard against immaterial and extra-dimensional intrusions. While on the Material Plane, it will see into both the Material and Spectral planes at the same time. It can clearly see for a mile on the Material, though it has ten times the range of vision on the Spectral plane. It has all the same vision modes you have, and you can use any spell to detect or see things through it. They always have Darkvision, Arcane Sight, and Detect Magic active. Your Arcane rank determines how well they can perceive and notice things, with the higher your rank the better their perception, easily reaching into the superhuman range by the 2nd or 3rd rank. They fly at about twice the speed of a normal human running, with perfect mobility. They require a moderate amount of Arcane to create, and no investment of your Artifice potential. You can have a number of them in existence at the same time based on your Intelligence. You can call one down anywhere on the same plane of existence as you, though you need some way of targeting the landing, of which you know several methods. Finally they can follow simple instructions on their own, and can 'contact' you for clarification, or you can actively control them, and they're well suited to searches or as sentinels.
        Greater Phylactery: An Arcane Lich who has achieved the penultimate technique of Artifice can create a Bound Phylactery, a greater form of Phylactery. There are many advantages to a Greater Phylactery. The first advantage is that they are far tougher than a normal Phylactery. You are always aware of where it is, as long as it's on the same plane as you. If it isn't, you're aware of what plane it is on. You always know when it's been touched by another being, and when it's taken damage. You can spend a trivial amount of Arcane to see the area around your Phylactery, and maintain that vision as long as you concentrate. Your Phylactery can also store up to six motes of Arcane energy, and regenerates a single one each day. You must be able to touch it to draw on that Arcane. You may also set up to six spells upon your Phylactery to trigger on contingencies you define. If they activate dangerous damaging spells, your Phylactery won't be harmed. You can hang six spells inside your Phylactery to draw upon when you need them. You don't need to be touching it to draw upon them, but it does take a moment of concentration. Creating a Greater Phylactery ties up an entire Rank's worth of Artifice Points.
        Bound Phylactery: The most ambitious liches won't be satisfied with a 'mere' Greater Phylactery. A bound phylactery isn't an object, it's a place. A house on chicken legs, an undersea palace of impossible geometries, a mountain. It takes physical work through the entire structure to be bound, and an investment of resources directly proportional to the volume being bound, but there is no limit on size. In return, a Lich can bind themselves to something that isn't carried so much as lived within. Here are some common properties that show up in most Bound Phylacteries.
        * You can see from anywhere on or in it, as if you were standing there.
        * You can teleport to any part of it for a modest cost in Arcane. You can be perfectly accurate with the spell as long as the destination is within or on it.
        * You can cast spells through it, as if you were there.
        * You can manipulate space and dimensions inside and around it.
        * You can make it shift and cause parts of it to move. If it's built correctly, you can make it walk la Baba Yaga's hut or Howl's Moving Castle.
        * You know everyone who is in contact with it, and where they are.
        * It regenerates at 5% of its total 'health' per day if damaged, and you can speed it up massively by meditating on making it fix itself.
        Bound Phylacteries are grand works of Artifice, and they tend to have unique properties in addition to these. It binds two whole ranks worth of Artifice points to make a Bound Phylactery. In addition to those more permanent constructions, Liches with the Arcana of Artifice also learn the technique of Arcane Enhancement. This essentially lets the lich turn prepared objects into enchanted objects with a temporary enhancement based on your Arcane State. As you bought this as a perk, you can always treat it as the final Arcane state (Spectral Lich), for an enhancement bonus of six on the item. You don't have to use the full bonus, as the higher bonus you use the more expensive in Arcane it gets. Such tools are Arcane weapons or armor. The Arcane Trait makes them especially good against the forces of the Void. In future worlds, it will work against forces of unmaking, oblivion, and the like, as well as undead in general. Weapons with the Arcane trait ignore defenses and immunities. Armor is stronger and helps you resist magical attacks. Other items are harder for forces of the void to resist. Who knows what incredible things you'll to make as your mastery of Artifice continues to grow?
        Grand Artificer (100CP)
        While every artificer will continue to grow in the amount of Artifice they can keep invested, your growth is doubled here. More than that, you find you can permanently empower things, freeing you from having to maintain an ongoing investment. It takes a fifty-to-one ratio of Arcane to Artifice to replace the Artifice investment, and you can't empower something beyond your theoretical maximum Artifice - how much you could invest if all of it was available for you to use at one time. Using this, it's possible to make Arcane Foci that other people can use. As long as all the investment is permanent investment paid in Arcane, then you can set criteria for who or what can use it. Note that there aren't a lot of limits on what an Arcane Foci can do. You can also make an Arcane Enhancement permanent. It requires ten times as much Arcane to make it permanent as temporary. Such enhancement overlaps with standard enchantment, but does count as the required '+1' needed before other special abilities might be added, and an item so enhanced is considered an Arcane Enchantment for the purposes of ignoring anti-magic and spells. Yes, you can make an item a permanent Arcana Foci with interesting abilities, make it permanently Arcane Enhanced, and then enchant it. Something like that is basically a minor artifact though, and represents a huge investment of time and effort, without other perks.


-Key of Golems | Unliving Soldiers (Lords of the Night - Liches) (300CP)
        Key of Golems (200CP)
        Upon buying this perk you gain access to the first level of the Arcana of Golems, and will naturally deepen your understanding and power in it over time with no more personal investment in that growth. Golems are a common tool for the Liches of the Guild of Wizards. The greatest are the semi-real Artifex Golems of the Order of Artifex, but making them is hardly limited to just those master craftsman. The common Arcane Golem is created from a Heart. These Golem Hearts are crafted from precious stones and metals, growing increasingly grand for more impressive Golem Hearts, and then they're empowered with an investment of energy. A lich may temporarily invest part of their Permanent Arcane, tying it up in the empowerment of the heart. They can reclaim that investment at any time, but the heart will break and must be crafted anew. Alternatively, if the Lich also practices the Arcana of Artifice, they may instead invest Artifice into empowering a Heart.
        A lich may only have a limited number of hearts in existence at once, restricted by the height of their Intelligence. Once empowered, a golem heart is very similar to a Occularum, though unlike those devices it has no sense of its own. Instead, it can bind its now immaterial essence to a piece of the world, and reshape that piece into a Golem. Such crude golems might be relatively weak on their own, but can channel a shadow of their makers might and skill. If destroyed, the Heart is dissipated from reality into potentiality for a time, but will reform after a day. It's also possible to build prepared vessels for the Golem Heart. Such vessels are far stronger than an ad-hoc animation, and the destruction of such a vessel will not dissipate the Golem Heart, letting it jump to a new vessel immediately. That strength though comes at the cost of, well, cost. Resources and time and effort to craft such. A Crystal Golem for example may be a juggernaut, but it's also a ten foot tall statue made of diamond and platinum. Making it costs. Obviously you are not limited to just Crystal Golems, and can use other materials you have access to, with more powerful and exotic materials tending to result in more powerful and exotic golems. With effort even things like the mighty and near indestructible Adamantium Golem may be in your reach. You may see out of the eyes of your Golems (or roughly where their head is, should they not have eyes), and project your mind into them to control them directly. They can obey simple orders and routines, and make fine guards and wardens, if unimaginative ones.
        Unliving Soldiers (100CP)
        Your Golem Hearts aren't LIKE Occularum. They are an extra set of Occularum, with all the abilities of one. Even when invested in matter, the Occularum part keeps watch around its golem, seeing and spying. They also gain real, if unimaginative, intelligence. They're as smart as a somewhat dumb mortal, but they're perfectly logical and throurogh, and they feel no emotions that would make them perform badly. In the end, they're surprisingly good at working around their limitations. They also reform in only six hours, and they're better at animating their bodies than normal golem hearts. They might have the same basic attributes, but their reflexes and skill at using those attributes is improved. Occularum abilities are described in the Key Of Artifice perk. Should you also possess the upgraded Key Of Artifice perk you may make these Occularum Golem Hearts without a permanent investiture of Arcane or Artifice energy, though it does still require an expenditure of such energies during the initial creation.


-Spirit Painting (Earth Girls) (300CP)
        Your paintings and artwork catch a little piece of their subject's soul in them. This isn't harmful at all in itself. This link between the subject and the artwork might have all sorts of effects. Someone whose picture you paint on a cave wall might always find their way back to it, painting a couple together might make their relationship long-lasting and happy, or painting big-tooths and boars might attract those animals to your village's hunting grounds.


-Talisman Adept (Inukami) (300CP)
        You are very skilled at using talismans. What that means is you can make them have different properties (like light or sound) and with enough time and training you can make truly devastating effects. You are much better at using talismans and can give them properties of what shape they are in. Shaped like a frog? These talismans can bounce towards their intended target.


-That Undefinable Thing (Tales of Symphonia) (300CP)
        Even if you can't describe it, you can still manipulate it. You can now make physical tools and containers for souls, as well as gaining the knowledge of how to use the soul as a power source for magic, machinery, and living bodies. Given proper resources (raw souls), you can create Exspheres and Key Crests which can then power the things mentioned in your place. Anything powered by their user's soul is known intimately to them, inhabited by the soul the same way a body is inhabited by a soul. It becomes in all ways an extension of the self, for good or ill. While the soul is infinite, it can be diminished and grown. Take care.


-The Arcane Craft (Sword and Sorcery) (300CP)
        As much as you might look down upon brutes and barbarians who know only how to break bone and spill blood, you and the warriors of this land have one thing in common. You require the tools of your trade. You know all the methods and ways to bind arcane and mysterious forces into physical vessels. Rings, staves, talismans, warded stone towers, and even more. These items allow the channeling of such forces to work your will, capturing, bending, and shaping the worlds invisible tides to enable works of sorcery and occult splendor. The strength of these items and their effects rely on your skill, knowledge, and power. Of course should you yourself be a font of such forces from your varied lives then you would be surely capable of building the focuses and talismans to augment and amplify your power. The world rewards men for diligent labor. It would behoove you to refine this art to get everything you can out of it. This also includes the skill to use such items, even those not made by your hand should you have the ability to reveal their secrets.


-Artisan of Moonsilver (Exalted - The Lunars) (400CP)
        While their tattoos are perhaps the most important artifacts any Lunar will ever bear, they are not the only artifacts in use by the Lunar Exalted. Not by a long shot. Many wonders have forged of the protean metal that is Moonsilver, exploiting the full potential of this mutable metal. These items are invaluable for the Children of the Moon, for they can change shape along with their owners. Indeed, many older Chosen of the Moon regard the use of moonsilver as the exclusive right of their kind. These elders tend to take a dim view of anyone else possessing moonsilver artifacts and may seize such items for themselves or to pass on to young Lunar protgs. Still, many young Lunars find they will have to create their own panoplies, for their elders often hoard these artifacts to themselves. It is a good thing then, that you are an exceptionally talented artisan, a master in all the mundane crafts and even further genius at working the mercurial Moonsilver that responds best to you. You have been granted the secrets of creating artifacts from that changeable metal, as well as how to make mundane armor into the Moon-Faced Mail that likewise shifts to fit whatever form you are currently wearing. Even the most important technique of the No Moons is known to you, the Form-Fixing Method that binds the moonsilver tattoos to the body of newly reincarnated Lunars.


-Badgesmith (Paper Mario) (400CP)
There are objects in this world called badges, which when worn are capable of granting new capabilities or modifying existing ones. How these come into being has been a mystery, but not to you. You know how to create badges, although you will only be able to recreate existing ones at first. With time and practice I'm certain you will be able to design new badges all your own.


-Celestial Technology (Darksiders) (400CP)
        Though they are not makers, the angels are a force of creation. This perk grants you their knowledge in supernatural technology they use. Holy armor, lances that shoot beams of light and all manner of technology that repels darkness and creatures of evil. You also become more skilled in the use of holy weapons.


-Creator | Arcane | Sorcerae | A Memory Of The Face Of Creation (Lords of the Night - Liches) (400CP)
        Creator (400CP)
        People focus on the grand secrets, the sublime arts, the intricate techniques of the Arcane. And all of these things exist. But before them all, the truth of the Arcane is simple. It is the Fire of Creation, the Spark that flares into the infinite possibilities of existence. It is a force of Making, and you are utterly in tune with that aspect. When you use Sorcerae to Create something permanently, it only costs two times as much as it does for a transitory thing instead of the ten times it would take normally and such works always have a grace to them that makes them subtly better than they should be, and if you could succeed at such a Sorcerae, you will do so with grace and panache. You might call it a 'natural 20.'
        Arcane | Sorcerae | A Memory Of The Face Of Creation (0CP) - See text in Tower of Sorcerae


-Crystal Metallurgy (Final Fantasy XIV) (400CP)
        You figure that it would only be a matter of time until somebody attempted to forge a suit of armor out of crystal. Frankly, with the materials available and the tools there, it's more of a surprise that it hasn't happened already. Of course when you actually try it, you'll realize why -the magic surrounding the crystals is simply too strong to be forged using traditional means. But if traditional means won't work, that just tells you that you need to employ more esoteric means of forging. Forging not with traditional fire, but with the concentrated essence of Aether and fire crystals, you can bring to life a suit of armor with crystal alone -retaining its Aether collecting properties, and magnifying the effects of spells all around it. Perhaps with time, you might be able to make golems with this


-Demon-Smith (Dota 2) (400CP)
        Many demons have had centuries to refine their skill at crafting, and despite the mortal assumption that your kind is only good for destruction, you've also learned to create great weapons. You are able to use complex crafting techniques capable of granting a simple steel blade an edge sharper than should be physically possible, but you've also learned to imbue your foul energies into that which you create. You begin by attempting to create an axe, and as the process goes on, you find it growing bone-like spikes and a gem on its guard which exudes a terrible malevolence. That its edge cuts the soul as much as it does the flesh is almost an afterthought once you wield it in battle and find yourself with an unnatural lifeforce that sees your wounds slowly mending even as you fight. You try to forge a weapon of two conflicting natures, and your own hateful being serves as a buffer that forces the entire thing to stay together despite it quite literally desiring to be sundered. The results are certain to be as varied as they are powerful, and you may learn to use this same corrupting technique with any other energies you may have. Keep in mind that you are literally pouring a portion of yourself into your work before you try to outfit an army. Hahsh Izh omoz, groth hollom chron voth icha Izh.


-Deplorable Forge of Tormented Souls | Hammer Upon the Wailing Muse (Exalted - The Abyssals) (400CP)
        Deplorable Forge of Tormented Souls (200CP)
        Proper soulforging is a highly specialized art that requires rarified equipment, access to Labyrinthine materials and a willingness on the part of the soulsmith to condemn another ghost to eternal torment. While the willingness to do so must come from yourself, almost everything else can be bought right here, providing you with equipment and inexhaustible supplies of the raw materials ones need to forge a soul into steel.
        Full usage of the craft requires artifacts to forge the metal, a hammer and anvil composed of soulsteel or jade (whichever you prefer) to hammer the molten ghost-alloys into shape, another artifact known as an Essence-forge to melt down the unfortunate ghost's corpus and other materials, soulfire crystals replete with essence to stoke the forge, and black ores taken from the Labyrinth to grant it the ghastly, magical strength of soulsteel.
        Even the alchemical agents, wrought from the Labyrinth, which are needed to create the rarefied void-coated plates of Oblivion's Panoply are in refilling supplies amongst these, should you have need of them. With this, the only thing you would still require for your dread craft is a supply of souls to feed your forge.
Hammer Upon the Wailing Muse (200CP)
        Much of the Underworld's economy rests on the production of soulsteel, one of the magical materials, which can only be produced by combining shavings from the walls of the Mouth of Oblivion with the melted corpus of a ghost. Forging soulsteel is difficult for even the best smiths.
        Soulforging is the process by which the souls of the dead are melted down and then shaped into useful items or are used to produce soulsteel. First, the corpus of a ghost is carefully heated with soulfire crystals so that it can be reduced to a viscous state without damaging its integrity. Once liquified, the corpus can be smelted with other materials and then worked into any shape appropriate to conventional metalworking.
        Soulforged items normally have the consistency of mortal steel. However, if the liquified corpus is smelted with molten ore taken from the Labyrinth, the result is soulsteel, one of the magical materials... and the only one that screams when struck with the smith's hammer. Proper soulforging is a highly specialized art that requires rarified equipment, access to Labyrinthine materials and a willingness on the part of the soulsmith to condemn another ghost to eternal torment. Understandably, soulforging is a heavily regulated art. But one you have mastered to extent rivaled by only a scant few amongst the dead, able to forge souls into proper soulsteel, combine soulforging with jadecrafting to forge sophisticated artifacts, and having gleaned the secrets of creating Oblivion's panoply, jealously guarded by the Deathlords. Though you would need to delve deep into necromancy to put the latter into actual practise.


-Doors that lead elsewhere (Dungeon Keeper) (400CP)
        Magically speaking, here and there are rather relative concepts, so why not take the easy route and build a dungeon that's here, there, and a little bit of somewhere else? While one cannot breach hellish boundaries with mere stonework, an auspicious floorplan can evoke the environments of other worlds through well-established principles of magical sympathy. If built precisely, the barriers between dimensions can become thin indeed within your dungeon, making summoning, teleportation and other exercises in dimensional manipulation almost effortless...and much more hazardous for your enemies, their own such spells at the risk of going awry in the worst ways and possibly drawing the ire of things best left undisturbed.


-Downsized  | Upsized  (Gemcraft Frostborn Wrath) (400CP)
Downsized (200CP)
        While gems the size of a room are the most efficient and stable, this perk will give you the skills necessary to create gems that are smaller than that. The strength of a gem relative to its cost scales with its volume, so small gems might seem useless at first glance, but gems effectively do not have an upper bound for how high they can scale. Feel free to make an Orb of Presence fit for a backpack, and carry around a staff with a gem on the top for blasting foes, or launch gem bombs the size of grenades and leave behind gem-wasps the size of flies to distract your foes.
Upsized (200CP)
        While making gems the size of entire buildings is possible for normal wizards, they usually don't bother, since they have a tendency to cause widespread devastation when they break, and that can endanger the wizard that cast the spells. If you don't mind working around the potentially deadly consequences of summoning huge gems, this perk will give you the skills necessary to scale your gems as large as you want, so long as the entire thing can fit within your spellcasting range. Of course, you will draw a lot of attention doing this.


-Fairy (Fate/Legends - Garden of Avalon) (400CP)
        Despite having human parents, you are a long way from being human yourself. An ancient, long buried heritage in your ancestry has awakened and you were born as a Fairy. A Fairy is an extension of Gaia, similar to how the hairs or fingers on your body are an extension of you. Despite this, you retain your free will completely, thus allowing you to benefit quite significantly from being considered a natural part of the world, especially when it comes to your magecraft being accepted as entirely natural. You are also able to become invisible to the senses of any being without magic.
        Beyond this, you have amazing talent in creating magic items and while you are right now a long way from crafting something like Excalibur or Arondight, you are still several times as skilled, fast and efficient in the creation of magical items as normal. Lastly, you have the potential, with enough power and/or age, to evolve into a full fledged Elemental, granting you greater authority and importance to the world, along with a not insignificant boost in power.
        In future worlds, you may choose to have a similar connection to the world you begin on as you do with Gaia here.


-Fragmentation (D.Y.N. Freaks) (400CP)
        The knowledge and process of creating Fragments has come into your possession. You're now able to turn individual or small, themed groups of your own powers or abilities into magical objects that allow other people to use those powers, bonding to the items, though you cannot make more than one Fragment for any given power. Though you can take these objects back at any time, those other than the bonded partner will find it very difficult to take out or even use the newly made Fragment. If you wish, you may make the Fragment slowly corrupt the user as they use more and more of its power, to the point that they eventually become either a beast or a mental and cosmetic copy of yourself, though they only possess the power you gave in the Fragment. Finally, you are able to moderate how much of the power you put into a Fragment that is able to be used, though you must still put the entire power in.


-Grousing Gadgeteer (Skulduggery Pleasant v1.05) (400CP)
        Like Ghastly Bespoke, Kenspeckle Grouse, and Doctor Rote all rolled into one, you have immense talent when it comes to the creation of all varieties of enchanted or magical items. Whether it's Ghastly's protective clothing, woven razor Cleaver scythes, a magical prison like the Cube, Kenspeckle Grouse's life-annihilating Desolation Engine, sentient magical machines like the Engineer, or even the magic-boosting Accelerator itself, you have the skills needed to create them. More powerful creations like the Cube and the Accelerator will certainly take more time, resources, and experimentation to fully develop, of course.


-Infusion (JoJo) (400CP)
        Besides infusing your body with Ripple, you can now direct the flow of energy at will. This will lead to a variety of effects, such as using Ripple to mend an ally's wounds. As well, you can infuse Ripple into objects. This improves existing qualities and makes them deadly to the undead and living alike.


-Jadework (World of Darkness - Kindred of the East) (400CP)
        The Green Courts are so named because of the vast stores of jade, which is bought and sold for great sums of money, political favors or whatever else that the vampires need. It can be worked into powerful talismans and used to store chi, so it definitely has its uses. You've acquired the skill needed to make many (though not all) of the talismans, and could easily learn more. Jade, as you might already know, is valuable to Shen for many reasons, not the least of which its use in various rites and chi storage. You've got the connections you need to buy and sell, but raw materials are hard to come by these days. In other worlds, this could be applied to similarly rarified and functional materials, particularly gems or those used for or by Shen.


-Legacy (Ravenwood) (400CP)
        In this strange plane of existence, things sometimes take on traits they were never meant to take, a spark of something greater. You gain the ability to imbue a spark within an object, even immaterial ones such as songs, that allow it to build up, or awaken, a legacy. If such an item is used for a feat, it will gain a property based on that feat. A pair of boots used to run the length of a country to bring important news may gain a property to increase the speed of the one wearing them in some minor way. A shield used to block the fire breath of a dragon may develop the power to resist flames, and impart that resistance to its wielder. Even simply using the item for its intended purpose will make it ever so slightly better for that purpose, such as a sword growing sharper or armor growing more durable, though it could take years to accumulate a noticeable effect in this way. These legacy abilities may be fairly weak on their own, but they stack up over time, with greater feats giving greater improvements (Note: You are not required to perform said feats. Anyone using the item may build on the legacy abilities). Using this ability on an item that has already accomplished great feats grants these same abilities, only stronger based on the time since those feats were performed, retroactively.


-Legends In The Making (Dota 2) (400CP)
        Many are content to find great artifacts with long and adored stories, but you've discovered the secret to creating them entirely. First, you have a modicum of crafting skill in nearly all areas. Swords, bows, armor, jewelry, while you're nothing to speak about you get the job done. However, sell a sword to a strapping young lad. Now sell a shield to some mercenary desperate to make more of his life after the boy dies, then sell a bow to some look. It might take a while, but you're going to make something for someone made of sterner stuff than most at some point, and that's when your craftsmanship shines. A knight using an armor crafted by yours truly slays a dragon despite being bathed in fire, then finds his armor having a design resembling scales once it cools down. Then, he discovers his armor quite literally drinks fire, heating up to harm nearby enemies while leaving him cool as a breeze. A ranger using a bow made by you shoots a monstrous avian in the wing from an absurdly long distance, and now any arrows fired from said bow home in on its target's weak points, seeking to cripple them. So it is, that when legendary Heroes are born, so are legendary implements. Curiously, those supernatural tools you inadvertently create always return to you, seemingly desiring for you to grant them new wielders. I'm sure you can figure out how to profit from this.


-Material Hybridization (Final Fantasy XIV) (400CP)
        Hybrid materials are the newest and hippest thing to come to Eorzea, since the presence of stolen Garlean magitek technology showed up. Now Alchemists all over Eorzea have been experimenting with this stolen technology, trying to reverse engineer the material and fundamentals behind the creation of such things. A worthy venture, and one from which you've perfected the art of making hybrid materials. Not a matter of making alloys, but making ores and fabrics enchanted with the elements, creating resources fundamentally tied with the Aether. firemetal, watermetal, the hybridization is limited only by the complexity of the element, and the nature of the material. You can't expect to succeed every time, but you'll never succeed if you don't try.


-Pocket Master (Luck of the Draw) (400CP)
        You have a rather interesting talent for building 'small' pocket dimensions. The more power you have when creating the dimension the more you can customize it, making it larger, move at different rates of time or have strange and or interesting effects like a wall of mist around the edges that allows you to walk into and out of on the opposite side of the pocket dimension. With enough practice, you could even include aspects of the world of dreams in your dimensions.


-Providence (Duel Monsters - Duel Terminal Part 1) (400CP)
        Ah, what an interesting trick. There is far more power in your body than one might expect. Quite literally, actually. When you give away part of your body willingly, the part so removed becomes akin to a magic item, holding supernatural abilities appropriate to the relevant part and your own wishes at the time of creation. Perhaps a cut of your mane large enough to use as a cloak could grant another your durability, or a scale from your legs could be used to grant them your speed. Of course, having more esoteric abilities will let you grant more esoteric effects. A fang capable of shattering enemy spells, or perhaps a claw capable of shooting beams of force when wielded like a sword? I won't presume to know everything you're capable of. Still, these items can't last forever, and every use of them will bring them closer to the breaking point. Equipping someone before they go on a monthslong journey is well within the cards, but I would not hope to stockpile these if I were you. The lingering will left inside those magic items will also make sure they can not be used in ways you'd disapprove of, as well.


-The Science of the Soul (The Games We Play) (400CP)
        The human soul is the oldest and most mysterious subject discussed by man. In this world, its existence is a proven fact, and anything that exists can be subjected to the pitiless processes of science. Like the Angels of ancient Babel, you are greatly skilled in the study and understanding of the soul, be it humans, animals or stranger. Just as someone would test and interact with chemicals or bodies or metals or whatever, you find yourself capable of designing devices and methods that can interact with souls, and things like them on the same level. You can measure them, diagnose them, operate on them and do pretty much anything else you can imagine to them. With time and some research, you might even be able to construct your own custom made souls from free Sephirot like the Angels once did, perhaps even custom designing it's abilities in the far future.


-Unlocking the Soul (Dark Souls 2) (400CP)
        Perhaps you have more ambition than just bestowing the mundane with mystical power. You aim for higher, you aim to transmute the power of souls into tools to be manipulated by your hand. Was I correct? Then look no further. You have been bestowed skills and abilities that allow you to transform souls and spiritual power into a variety of ways. The most basic is using weaker souls, and crystallizing them into Lifegems, objects that can mend and repair flesh when broken in hand. The basic is just an example however, but a good one. Crystallizing souls, making their essence physical and widening the potential to interact with them. With such abilities, powerful souls can be transformed into weapons and trinkets, or golems powered by batteries made of souls.


-Writ of Worlds (Exalted - The Infernals) (400CP)
        All things that enter under the influence of the Sphere of Speech dissolve into whispering glyphs that hang upon the air, writings that spell out their own identities and qualities in the numberless languages that are Elloge. Within her inner realms perception and travel are difficult for intruders hailing from conventionally physical realms, requiring them to acclimate themselves to formless aural or textual existence so that they might explore the peculiar volumes of her inner spaces. Drawing upon some of her power, you may spell out the identities and qualities of those things you would like to create. Instead of physical means you may use your own writings to create objects of symbolic reality defined by the whispering glyphs. Forge swords of biting retorts, traps of erotic expressions like barbed hooks, cryptic devices, winding paths of efflorescent prose, and even living beings like savage packs of itinerant paradoxes and koans. All these may be created by you, even if the creation of permanent literature requires the same care that the forging of artifacts would, lest they reach the end of their narratives after some time in an unwritten world.


-Mo Weapon Master | Holy Mo Forging Pool (World of Cultivation) (500CP)
        Mo Weapon Master (200CP)
        The way the Mo forge their weapons is unique from how Xiuzhe create their talismans. Through the process of forging already high class materials the Mo forging method focuses far less on creating a weapon with specific new traits, and focuses far more on emphasising and enhancing the properties which already exist in the materials by forging them in the deep cold flowing waters of the Mo Forging Pools.
        You are now a master Mo Weaponsmith, able to look at a pile of materials and bring out the absolute best of what they could be, enhancing the traits they would naturally have if you forged them. A dagger forged from a beast which breathed fire will have a fiery aura, or even possibly burn upon touch of the blade, while more complex things such as a sword made from the tongue of a rotten undead carp soaked in the water of a necrotic realm may be able to cause things in a small area to decompose. Through hard work and study you can do much with this art, and should you have other means of forging or creating weapons the results will only grow more impressive. Also comes with the knowledge of how to create a Mo Weapon Forging Pool.
        Holy Mo Forging Pool (300CP)
        The Underground Nether River is silent, it is 60 feet wide and spectacular to see. The river water of the Underground Nether River is as sticky as glue, is black yet clear, and flows without making a sound. The water in this river is extremely suitable for the creation of Mo Weapons, by placing a part of yourself or another creature as well as a weapon into the waters you can guide them to merge and create a Mo Weapon, a weapon connected to you much like a talisman or a flying sword, though often times more powerful, not because of superior forging techniques but because of the superior materials conglomerating to create a weapon.
        The pool has the special property to not only work well for forging Mo Weapons it also has the effect of combining multiple weapons or items into one, as Xiao Mo Ge did with his Sky Snake Ten Transformations Pike. Doing this imbues all the powers of the items into one while allowing them to shift between the forms of up to ten of the items used in its creation. For example the Sky Snake Ten Transformations Pike was a powerful Earth Mo Weapon created, but its real power came from its ability to shift into ten different weapons in an instant. Now you can create something similar.
        When used to forge with the parts of a creature it forges a better weapon depending on how strong the creature was and has minor affinities based on the creature and part used. For instance using the claw of a fire dragon will probably create a fire attributed Mo Weapon ranging between a dagger and a sword (considering how big the claw is). Though weapons created will be much more impressive if you have some training in forging already
        After the jump it can become a warehouse attachment should you wish it.


-Order of Artifex | Useless! | Arcane | Sorcerae | A Memory Of The Face Of Creation (Lords of the Night - Liches) (500CP)
        Order of Artifex (500CP)
You have gained the Mark of Artifex. Your body becomes more drawn out, thinner. Long delicate fingers, sunken eyes. You develop phantom ink and oil stains on your skin, if you still have skin. At the end of the Jump, these effects will become a template you may apply or remove as you wish. But that's just your body, the thing you probably care the least about. You are of the Artifex, the great Craftsman of the Guild of Wizards. The true mark isn't on your body, but the body that you make, your Artifex golem.
An Artifex golem is crafted from a ripped free fragment of your intellect, will, and force of personality, damaging you when it’s first created, though this damage will heal over time. It also requires an investment of the same while you manifest it, though that cost is covered by you buying this perk.
An Artifex Golem’s advancement is normally linked to your Arcane State, but yours grows independent of that. A new Artifex Lich normally creates a Golem slightly weaker than a Flesh Golem, while a Spectral Lich creates something the equal of an Anaxim. 
Artifex golems, being made of thought rather than matter can be summoned and dismissed with a thought, but can only exist near you. Normally this would be limited by your Arcane State, but as you paid for this, you have the maximum range, like a Spectral Lich. You can manifest or send your Golem up to 200 yards away. 
Your Artifex golem shares your resistances to damage. You may transfer health to and from your Golem. You may also meditate to heal your golem at a decent rate.
All Artifex Liches excel at crafts, just being better at them then they should be. You also receive half again as much Artifice as another lich. You are also slightly better at Sorcerae that conjures or creates things.
Lastly, you gain the Arcana of Artifex. You gain access to the first level of the Arcana of Artifex, and will naturally deepen your understanding and power in it over time with no more personal investment in that growth.
Artifex allows you to enhance your projected Artifex Golem, giving it the essence of different materials to further strengthen it. Magically pure examples of that element are invested in the golem, which are expensive to acquire and can normally only be purchased in Kethak, though nothing stops you from sourcing your own should you have other methods, or experimenting with more exotic materials.
The possible enhancements are
* Quartz for Strength 
* Granite for Armor
* Mercury for Dexterity 
* Platinum to grant it fast healing. 
* Diamond to make it tougher and able to take more damage 
* Sapphire to give it a freezing aura and make its strikes bite with cold. Incompatible with Ruby. 
* Ruby to give it a burning aura and make its strikes burn with flame. Incompatible with Sapphire. 
* Adamantine to make it resist all damage from lesser sources.
While the initial enhancement is small, it can be grown by binding a piece of mind and intellect to further grow that enhancement, with a greater binding allowing for more enhancement, capped by the lich’s normal intelligence. 
It can be enhanced further with Arcane energy, capped by the lich’s rank of accomplishment in the Arcana of Artifex. Finally, since it’s made of thought, you can basically have it manifest looking however you might want it to look, and since it is (very) technically a form of summon after being made, any abilities you have that enhance summons will also work on it.
        Useless! (100CP)
You find that your Artifex Golem is greater than others of its kind. Even when manifested, it is corporeal or incorporeal as would be most advantageous at that moment. A telekinetic barrier of intent deflects away harm, greatly armoring it based on your intelligence. You also find that you don't need to invest mind and intellect to empower it through the Arcana of Artifex - the fragment of mind you've invested to create it will maintain its own enhancements. You may still further enhance it by pouring in Arcana, to push it to the absolute limit. If your golem is destroyed, you can quickly rebuild it, and the personal cost is lessened, so that it takes only hours to recover from creating your Golem.

-Advent of Aquamirror (Duel Monsters - Duel Terminal Part 2) (600CP)
        As you know, the original Aquamirror once used to be the Mirror of the Ice Barrier, an artifact meant to control, suppress, and seal the three Dragons of the Ice Barrier. Through her own expertise, Noellia altered it into a tool for communication, hypnosis, and performing all kinds of rituals. While you might not necessarily have something worthy of your skills to use, you too have reached this level of prowess. Altering magical items to perform completely different functions is something you could do if given a mere month or two to study them. Simple tweaks, such as removing a fire scepter's ability to create fire to augment its ability to command fire, would require seconds at most. Actually improving an item is a lot more involved, and could take years of work to see any noticeable change, but is well within your capabilities, as is reverse engineering them outright.


-Ars Magus Creation | Armagus Creation (Blazblue) (600CP)
        Ars Magus Creation (100CP)
        You have basic education in the creation and modification of Ars Magus. You understand how they work and how to create non-combat Grimoires, though you require time and resources in order to do so.
        Armagus Creation (300CP)
        ! requires Ars Magus Creation! You have advanced education in the creation and modification of Ars Armagus. Armagus on the whole are dangerous and unstable weapons if they're used by someone who doesn't know what they're doing, and creating them is no less dangerous because even one glimpse into the Boundary is enough to shred a man's sanity permanently. However, anything you make will invariably be better than anything you can buy in a store or on the black market.
Ars Creation Tools (200CP)
        Tools required to make Ars Magus and Ars Armagus. Without these, creating such things would be impossible, because creating the converter to let the user manipulate Seithr requires these specialized tools for the process to work properly.


-Artifact Savant (Marvel Magic) (600CP)
        Agomotto, the first Sorcerer Supreme of earth, created many wondrous things still in use all of these millennia later. Perhaps his most notable creation was that of the Three-Fold Path, a system of magic still in widespread use today. But also extremely important were the potent magical artifacts he created, many of which serve invaluable roles as badges of office for the Sorcerer Supreme and tools for the defense of all existence. You understand just how powerful and important such tools can be, for you yourself are a skilled and talented enchanter. You find that imbuing items with powers is a simple matter for you, overlaying nearly any spell or magical ability you know onto some item to more easily invoke it yourself or even to allow others to do so. Though you are not yet as skilled in the creation of such wonders as Agomotto, this may yet change in time. Perhaps you will even find a way to permanently imbue living beings with your magic to grant them great powers of their own.


-Blood Artisan Plus (Bloodborne) (600CP)
        You have been granted an experienced artisan's knowledge on crafting things out of blood. This is basically an overall improved version of Blood Artisan, allowing you to craft more potent Blood Vials, larger Blood Stones and even Blood Gems. Blood Gems are supernatural gems formed from blood that can be slotted into weapons to give them a variety of special abilities. Some Blood Gems can make an edge sharper, or a tip pointer. Other gems can bathe a weapon in fire, poison or electricity to make them more effective against certain enemies. Some gems can even increase your strength or dexterity while wielding the weapon it's slotted in. Their magical powers can be stacked, to an extent at least. This means you may slot up to three different Blood Gems in the same weapon, though no more. Blood Gems can be slotted and removed with special equipment.


-Code Creator (Fate/Zero) (600CP)
        Many Magi rarely move beyond their own field of focus when crafting items imbued with magical power. What reason would there be when they could simply pay for another Magi to make something if they absolutely needed it? You're one of these skilled experts that others come to. Obviously in your chosen field, you're one of the great masters in creating magical items, such that something like Volumen Hydrargyrum wouldn't be hard at all, but even when it comes to fields of magic you have no knowledge in at all you can get surprising results. So long as someone with the requisite knowledge is nearby and willing, you can draw on their knowledge of the subject as you work, effectively combining your skills with their knowledge to become a master craftsman in fields that you have no knowledge of.


-Forge Wyrm (Dungeons and Dragons the Dragons) (600CP)
        Dragons are often lazy creatures, sleeping away the centuries on great piles of wealth. But there are always exceptions. Some dragons choose instead to turn their minds to craftsmanship, and these can produce some of the greatest magical artifacts known to exist. Indeed, by combining your natural breath weapon, immense intellect, aptitude for magic, and a bit of either permanent investment of your own power or scavenged magic from other magical items, you may turn raw resources into any magical item known to exist, perhaps even artifacts who defy the known laws of magical items. This will, of course, take proportionately greater investments of effort and rare materials, yet to a dragon this is a lesser downside than it is to one of the shorter-lived races. Even so, for the greatest magical items it may be a long quest on its own to gather up the resources to even begin creating it. Of course, you will be able to find analogues to the raw resources in future worlds. You don't even need to work it directly with your own claws, for this comes with magic that can enable you to shape raw goods with exceptional precision and dexterity. Additionally, you are equally capable of leading entire teams in crafting projects at a time, perhaps organizing mindless golems or hired help.


-I Send My Sword (Highschool DxD) (600CP)
        Something many forget in this age is that it was the hand of God that created the Sacred Gears, and granted them to humans so that they may work miracles on the world. The secrets of this art died with Him, but the impact they leave on the world has echoed throughout time and history. You have gained a shadow of this art, with the ability to forge Holy Blades...not True Holy Blades, but powerful weapons that burn away the infernal and cut deeply against Devils or wicked creatures. More than that, you have a sense of others besides yourself who can shape the course of history if granted such a weapon, or any power you can pass to them, and a very accurate idea of how they will change the world around them for better or worse. All it will take is a mysterious, angelic figure granting them what they need when the moment calls for it. In time, you may be able to forge True Holy Blades after some trial and error, forging kin to legendary weapons such as Durandal and Excalibur.


-Item Construction EX (Fate Servant Supplement) (600CP)
        The Skill to manufacture magical items, from implements of war to items for daily use. The EX Rank represents something that falls outside of the numerical ranking scale, a value that cannot be quantified under the normal system because it is in a league of its own, powerful to the extent of rendering comparisons meaningless. (Descriptions taken from the Type-Moon wiki.) You have the knowledge and skill to build things rivaling anything seen in the Fate franchise.
        EX: Able to make healing potions that grant true immortality, craft Kaleidosticks and other world altering artifacts.
        A: Capable of making healing potions that grant limited immortality.
        B: Production of devices that carry magic power.


-Labyrinth Creation (Fate/Extra) (600CP)
        The Moon Cell creates entire Reality Marbles to simulate each area in the Grail War, including the Lunar Seas where Servant Battles take place. While you're not able to replicate this incredible feat, you can being to create Lunar Sea like pockets of your own. While you can always decide the general theme to the dungeon and it's enemies, at first, these will be small dungeons, perhaps only a dozen rooms and connecting hallways, and filled with weak fodder that will only drop cheap items. As you grow more experienced, all these parameters will expand. Eventually you could create grand labyrinths with multiple floors and dozens of rooms a piece, enemies will grow in strength and their item drops will increase to match. You do not have any more control over this however, at most you may simply choose the general size and strength of each dungeon, nor will the enemies within ignore you.


-Magic Maker (The Gamer) (600CP)
        High class enchanted objects in this world are quite rare. While this is to be somewhat expected, they are also suitably expensive, due to the sheer difficulty in making them.
        You now have the skill to do so. And as a bonus, there is no drop off, no 'you must have absolutely mastered fire magic to even create a weak fire enchantment', no 'hundreds of times the power requirement to create the item'. Any magical effect you know, you can create a talisman or item to replicate. Staff of nuclear fireball, ring of haste, anything you know, you can make.


-Magic Smithing (Hellboy) (600CP)
        The Golden Army, the Crown of Bethmora, Nuada's Spear such relics as these are beyond the ken of humans. But you can not only understand their construction and the magic behind them; you can create wonders of your own. Self-repairing golems, magical artifacts that control them no matter the size of the horde, spear tips that inch ever closer to the heart and cannot be removed by mortal means and much more are possible for you to create now. Though, getting all that gold might pose a problem


-Microcosm (Greek Myth) (600CP)
        Like the shield of Achilles your creations can contain microcosms. You could place within a sword the power of a raging thunder storm, sing a song that carries the components of civilization that would allow it's most important ideas to be transmitted through it's words, even very complex ideas like how the men of Greece live and understand the world can be placed with a creation of yours. This empowers an item by allowing it to act in some way as if it were the thing imbued within it, albeit in a diminished from the form they are embodying. Striking a shield which contains a microcosm of Greece would be like trying to strike through Greece, being struck by a sword containing Greece would be like being struck by Greece. However the microcosms you place within items will be greatly reduced compared to the actual thing they are embodying. A song containing civilization would only be able to get across the most important ideas with very little nuance, a sword containing a storm would strike with the force of a single thunderbolt rather than the thousands within the true storm, being struck by a shield containing Greece would be like being hit by a mountain rather than a country. It would take incredibly intense effort to create anything containing a microcosm more powerful or complex then Greece.


-Natural Remedies | Artificer (Twokinds) (600CP) 
Natural Remedies (200CP)
 Academic pursuits are all fine and good, but mages need to make a living like anyone else. To that effect, most of the magically inclined make money by selling alchemical solutions and other plant-based compounds. Your knowledge of alchemy and herbalism lets you craft everything from common medicines to potent poisons. While not as powerful as purpose-built magic, these natural alternatives are the preferred purchases for all but the wealthiest of patrons. Any village would welcome an alchemist like you.  
Artificer (400CP)
        Of course, plenty of people will pay serious coin for self-contained magic. You now have the skill to build magical artifacts and constructs. These items can replicate any spell you are capable of casting, so long as they are supplied with sufficient mana. More powerful artifacts will require more expensive materials and longer construction times, but the demand for reliable, consistent spellworks exists in every community on Mekkan. Whether you make these devices for yourself or for others, your devices are only limited by your access to materials and arcane knowledge. If you have the Natural Remedies perk, you may now brew potions that confer spell effects. Whether you bottle an Invisibility spell or cook up a cauldron of Cat's Grace, your spells now come in a convenient liquid package.


-Soulfuse arts (Talisman Emperor - Mortal Dimension) (600CP)
        While some powerful artifacts have Immortal Spirits which can briefly animate them, these spirits are somewhat limited. Though all are powerful and many are intelligent, they cannot cultivate and therefore cannot fundamentally change themselves. The Soulfuse Arts break this limitation, allowing a loose soul to bond with a Magic Treasure as a body and cultivate with a potential of at least the Heavenly Immortal Realm. While these arts are normally practiced with existing artifact spirits, it is also possible to use them to bind other souls. At a minimum, this makes the treasures intelligent and capable of wielding themselves, though the latter is draining.


-The Master (Martial World) (600CP)
        You gained enough understanding, knowledge and experience to start the path of an inscription, array and alchemy, with this you can create new recipes and method to substitute rare, extinct ingredients and materials with common ones but has same effect and effectiveness, you can also understand any pills, array or inscription that you see instantly and replicate it with less time and materials used, this also allows to invent pills, array and inscription from scratch when facing a difficult situation that a pills, array and inscription can help like breaking through the nine stars of dao palace, post-jump this applies to potions, seals, runes, barriers as well.


-Tool Creation (Fate/Legends - Empire of Antiquity) (600CP)
        The ability to make and alter tools at an astonishing level. Designing and crafting magical tools of exceptional power is easy, from potions to magical weapons to siege engines, and even creating non-magical implements that can accomplish magical effects at a lower level is entirely possible. You could with time, design and create some of the greatest weapons wielded by heroes in this age, provided you find the tools and resources you'd need to do it. Your talents lie particularly towards weapons of destruction and war, as your inventions in that area seem to end up having far more power, lethality and effectiveness than you had expected from what you designed. Lastly, when forced to spend time amongst other living beings, you also find that your capabilities with tools can be applied in certain ways to living beings, letting you trick and manipulate other people to do what you want with quite a high degree of skill.


-Weapon Synthesis (Dark Cloud) (600CP)
        By now, you've probably come to realize that the weapons in this world are quite peculiar. We're not talking about the Slingshot that speaks to you by the way, the Fairy King had a hand in that one. How does one crystallize a weapon? We're honestly not quite sure, though the magic seems to be consistent with the Atlamillia's properties. The crystals are surely a handy way to store the weapons - but you can also use them to merge into other inanimate objects, passing down a single property of the crystallized weapon as it were.


-Rare Talent: The Ability to Craft Ter'angreal (Luck of the Draw) (800CP)
        You have a rare talent such as, a rather impressive animagus form, being a metamorphmagus, the ability to craft ter'angreal, you're a vampire slayer, identifying magical items by looking at them, dream walking, wandless magic, creating seeds for angreal, making Cuendillar/Heartstone, reliable foretelling, force battle meditation or the like. This may be bought twice per specialty, once is enough to give you the potential to be one of the best possible with your talent, twice is enough to put you in the realm of legends. If something requires magic to work you have the minimum ability you need in order to use your talent. In other words, you could be nearly a squib and have an animagus form or wandless magic. It's highly recommended that you pick up a decent magic source to go with your talents if they require magic.
        * Generic magical items from wheel of time


-Unshackled Potential (Generic Fantasy RPG) (800CP)
        You know, for all the advantages an adventurer from a noble background holds over one with a humble origin, there isn't much disparity in terms of power level when both reach the epic levels. That's because Adventurers in general possess a ridiculous amount of potential. You, however, are a whole different animal - where even the most promising of Adventurers will one day reach the apex of their potential and be unable to advance further, you will never reach the apex of your potential because you will always be able to improve yourself in every respect, whether physical, magical, or even mundane skills, if you're into it.
        MYSTIC - The Artificer Magical artifacts, and perhaps even magi-technological artifacts if you know the right disciplines, come together under your hands and tools with the casual ease of a master. You can invent, develop, and introduce an item that can reproduce just about any magical effect you are personally capable of. While your initial prototypes might only just work, and not terribly well, you'll always be able to continually improve on your designs, with no particular ceiling in what you can manage beyond the time you're willing to invest and dedicate towards improvement. Furthermore, the rate at which you make improvements, and just design and build such artifacts in the first place, is tremendously enhanced, far beyond what other individuals that fancy themselves artificers could manage. Where the creation of magical items for the average practitioner is a long involved process requiring careful and painstaking effort, you are practically the equivalent of a one (wo)man production line. Finally, you may substitute pure magical energy for all but the rarest materials required during the creation process of your artifacts, though at an extremely unfavorable cost ratio until you dedicate significant time and effort towards refining this ability.


-Crafting Classes | Realm of Heroes | Level 100 (Overlord - The Series) (1100CP)
        Crafting Classes (200CP)
        You now possess classes and abilities aspected towards and in the service of creating a specific type of craft or trade good, and will be able to easily come up with new recipes or innovations for the crafts you select. Examples include cooking, smithing, scroll making, jewelry crafting, and so forth. For 50 cp you may choose one specific type of craft, however for 200cp you may instead have crafting abilities that are equally applicable to every possible crafting pursuit. Examples include food and drinks that give low level buffs when eaten, low end (but still serviceable) magical weapons, armors, and misc magic items, and so forth. The sort of equipment that would be considered useful and practical enough (in terms of use and cost) for even a more experienced adventurer to eye them appreciatively and think them a worthy addition to their arsenal.
        In the Realm of Heroes however you could make items that would be considered national treasures by the locals, things like swords so sharp that they could hit 'above their level' such as damaging someone that would normally ignore them (for example, bypassing the high-tier physical nullification of a level 100), rings of potent regeneration and stamina recovery, masterwork armor that even a hero would be honored to wear, food and drink that could potentially heal a man of injury instantly or empower him to staggering heights (temporarily at least), and so forth.
        At Level One Hundred however your crafting skills have hit their zenith. At this point you could make items on par with Divine Tier equipment, things even beings of godlike strength would find no complaint in, or foods and drinks so nourishing that someone might not need to eat or drink for a month or more afterwards, and conveying extremely potent temporary buffs alongside that. However, of course, no matter what your level of skill one simple fact remains; your skills are largely worthless without materials to use them with. While you might be able to take even subpar ingredients and fashion something workable only with truly excellent materials will you be able to craft something genuinely great, especially at the highest levels of crafting.
        Realm of Heroes (300CP)
        You have stepped into a realm that only the greatest that have ever lived can truthfully claim to be a part of.
        If you are a Warrior you could potentially cut down an army of a thousand regular men all by yourself, and would be capable of feats of skill and martial prowess that would leave regular folk in stunned awe of your capabilities, and have them whispering that maybe you aren't a mortal at all.
        If you are a Magic Caster you are capable of spells up to the sixth tier, believed to be the highest tier of magic that a mortal could possibly ever achieve. Spells of the sixth tier can perform things that would be miraculous to the common folk, such as resurrecting the dead, teleporting over unbelievable distances without error, summoning forth powerful creatures as servitors, or potentially casting spells that would let you defeat upwards of a hundred men with no more than a few words and gestures.
        If you are a Generalist your luck, wit, cunning, and skill are so profound that you have an answer for virtually every situation, and while your combat prowess won't be as great as a warrior of the same level, and your magic won't be as good as a magic caster of the same level, you'll far outstrip anyone that isn't in the realm of heroes in those abilities.
        Level 100 (600CP)
        You've hit the pinnacle. There is no higher level, not within YGGDRASIL at least. As a Player you have hit level 100, not exactly a surprise since most Players had done that, and represent the absolute peak of personal power and ability. If you're a Local then you're quite frankly a freak of nature and are probably seen as a god by any other locals that actually know what you're really capable of. Literally, by the way, the Slane Theocracy actually worships as gods a group of six level one hundred Players that appeared to them in the past, though virtually no one still alive outside the highest echelons of the Theocracy itself actually knows that. All level one hundred individuals possess high-tier nullification defensive abilities. This means that individuals won't be able to even hurt you that aren't, at the very least, within the fabled 'Realm of Heroes' and even then they'd have to be a hero among heroes to manage it, and they'd still have to get past your normal defenses even if they manage that much. The only hope they'd normally have is if they possessed access to some magical artifact of sufficient power to get past your defenses. That said the high-tier nullification is an all or nothing ability, either it works or it doesn't.
        Your physical and magical statistics are absolutely mind boggling as far as the locals are concerned. Even magic casters, if they're level one hundred, will possess physical strength and defenses on par with a warrior that is 'only' in the 'Realm of Heroes', and warriors can expect to be far far beyond even that. Magic casters actual magic power is enough that it could literally bring even the greatest human archmage to his knees in awe and shame at his own weakness, were he to actually witness your true strength. Even warriors that only dabbled in magic would still be on par with magic casters in the 'Realm of Heroes' at the very least. The abilities of a Generalist, both physical and magical, will outstrip everyone other than their level 100 peers by a tremendous degree.
        As a warrior you are capable of annihilating armies of tens of thousands of regular men on your own, and likely wouldn't even notice them. It would take legendary heroes or beasts to actually make you break your stride. You'll possess skills that will let you nullify certain damage types outright, perform swings of your weapon that can hit dozens of individuals at once with air pressure alone, and provide you with a myriad of defenses against magic casters that would seek to stymie you and prevent you from closing the distance. You are literally a one-man army killing machine. As a Warrior you additionally possess 'super moves' that can do things like grant temporary invulnerability to virtually anything, allow you to strike everything in your line of sight with a single powerful blow at the same time, or hit one opponent dozens of times with a single strike.
        As a magic caster you are capable of casting spells of every tier up to the 10th Tier. This is a tier of magic that only a bare handful of people in the entire world even know exists, with most believing that 7th tier is as high as it goes. 10th Tier magic is the stuff of legends, capable of healing armies or slaying them, resurrecting the dead en mass, permanent teleportation circles, 'buffing' or 'debuffing' entire armies, summoning forth creatures of legend as servitors, and so forth. As a Magic Caster you'll also be capable of 'Over-rank Magic', also known as Super-tier magic, that exceeds even that. Singular spells that could slay 70,000 men in one go and then also summon massively powerful eldritch nightmares under your command at the same time, destroying entire cities with rain that infects those it falls upon with an undead plague, conjuring forth miles upon miles of enchanted forest that responds to your will and will empower you while you are within, or spells of similar such scale and effect. Unlike normal spells 'over-rank' spells don't actually cost mana and are more akin to skills, they always have a long casting time, usually a minute or so, and you must stand still and can not do anything else while casting them. Additionally you can only use them a few times per day.
        If you are a Generalist there really isn't a question of 'can you do something' so much as 'how do you do it today, and will you do it differently tomorrow'. You're not quite on the same tier of skill as the warrior at combat, or the magic caster at magic, but you're just below both of them. Magic of the 9th tier is yours to command, and while you're not the combat beast a warrior could be you find that your command of both the physical and magical aspects give you a range of utility and versatility no one else could boast. As a Generalist you don't benefit from super moves or over-rank magic but in compensation your statistics are significantly better overall in the areas where the other origins would be weak. You do have one area however where you particularly shine. You are blisteringly fast. You could run circles around the warrior even if you couldn't beat him at swordplay, and you can certainly close the distance (or run away) from a magic caster in the blink of an eye. You've also picked up a penchant for sneak attacks, and opponents that don't see you coming rarely get the opportunity to learn from that mistake.


-Soulcraft | Sage (Demons' Souls) (1200CP)
        Soulcraft (600CP)
        With the souls of strong opponents, you may forge great weapons and armor out of them. Of course you can craft with lesser souls but the product won't be that great. The weaker souls can only be used to upgrade things instead. You instinctively understand how to use anything you made.
        Sage (600CP)
        In magic you have few equals, many of them brilliant prodigies much like yourself. Your intelligence improves the damages of your spells. With study you can turn great souls into powerful spells to be used. Weaker souls can be used to improve your magic


-Ruinous Font | A Messy Process | Preservation of Ruin | Hemalurgic Genius (Mistborn) (1300CP)
Ruinous Font (100CP)
        Hemalurgy is a dangerous and dark art, with a natural connection to the god of Destruction, Ruin. Through this connection, Ruin can manipulate the beneficiaries of Hemalurgy towards his own destructive ends. With this perk, you gain the tiniest sliver of Ruin's power just enough to fuel your own Hemalurgy without Ruin's help. Hemalurgic spikes you create have no connection to Ruin, and their users cannot be controlled by him or by emotional Allomancy. You can also make Hemalurgic spikes outside of this Jump. This does not confer any knowledge or ability with Hemalurgy you'll either have to take another perk, or find someone who can teach you. Unfortunately, the only people who can teach you are more likely to kill you instead.
        A Messy Process (200CP)
        You have a basic knowledge of Hemalurgy. You know which metals steal which attributes, if you didn't already. More importantly, you have a basic knowledge of the bind points on a human body, and you have a superhumanly steady hand when preparing to drive sharp metal objects into someone's body, even your own. In addition to some minor combat benefits, you can safely use place a hemalurgic spike into somebody's body in the exact right location to avoid injuring them and allowing them to draw on its power. However, the ability to twist humans into nonhuman forms or to implant hemalurgic spikes into nonhumans is beyond you. You can make Hemalurgic spikes outside this Jump if you do not already have the ability, but without Ruinous Font, anyone outside this Jump given a spike will eventually go violently insane.
        Preservation of Ruin (400CP)
        You can now charge a Hemalurgic spike without killing the victim. So long as the metal touches their still coursing blood, energy will be drained from the victim to charge the spike, leaving them alive. A spike made in this fashion will be slightly less powerful, but will last longer outside a human body. A victim drained by this ability will become noticeably paler, and their personality will shift to become slightly more dour and less energetic. If the drained attribute is a supernatural ability, it is removed entirely if it is a natural ability such as strength, it is radically weakened. You can make Hemalurgic spikes outside this Jump if you do not already have the ability, but without Ruinous Font, anyone outside this Jump given a spike will eventually go violently insane.
        Hemalurgic Genius (600CP)
        You are a genius in the art of Hemalurgy. You have the knowledge to twist a humans form into a variety of shapes with Hemalurgy, creating entirely new creatures formed from the hemalurgic charge in the spike and the recipient's own soul. This process usually requires multiple spikes, and twisting a human too far from their natural form can destroy their mind. The more a person is twisted in this fashion, the more powerful the charge in their spikes becomes, enhancing whatever abilities they gain from it. You also gain the ability to find the bind points in any nonhuman creature. Creatures that are largely humanoid only take a few minutes of visual inspection animals can take hours of intensive study. Sufficiently bizarre creatures may require days or weeks, and you may need to perform vivisection or other intrusive and indepth analysis in order fully map the creature's bind points. As a side benefit, hemalurgic spikes you make are more efficient, storing greater chargers and degrading slower than normal. You can make Hemalurgic spikes outside this Jump if you do not already have the ability, but without Ruinous Font, anyone outside this Jump given a spike will eventually go violently insane. Furthermore, attempting to use this ability without A Messy Process results in having very little control over the exact mutations your subject manifests. You know which bind points trigger mutation, but without the knowledge of which bind point does what you're largely striking blind. Experimentation can teach you, of course.


-Maker's Prodigy | Maker (Darksiders) (1800CP)
        Maker's Prodigy (600CP)
        The makers decide to teach you the ways of creation and you may choose to become their pupil, they will teach you how to create magical artifacts, imbue places and objects with power and even how to create magical constructs with sentience. Regardless if you spend the time learning from them or not, you will find you learn future skills related to creation, enchantment and forging will come to you as if they were second nature, waiting to be remembered.
        Maker (1200CP)
        You gain an alternate form of a maker, broad, Immensely strong and around 12 feet tall. You also gain supernatural powers of creation, able to make impossible things from practically nothing. Though it may take many years of practice, you will be able to master the art of crafting life from clay, Forge magic spells from ideas of the mind, and matter from nothing. Creator's spark: If you ascend and receive a Planeswalkers spark, you will find your knowledge of crafting extends unto the impossible and the laws of reality. You may eventually create new worlds from the void and forge new forces such as a unique form of magic or entropy as you create the new plane.




 --- Domain: Crafting: Magitech (31) (35 Perks) --- 




-Crystal Mechanics (Final Fantasy Type 0) (100CP)
        The Byakko Crystal's blessing revolves around the synthesis and comprehension of technology using magic. After all, sufficiently advanced technology is no different from magic. You can understand the workings of advanced technology after tinkering around with it a bit. You can also replicate technology you see by using magic, but until you've attempted it countless times, the end product always seems to feel a bit...lesser in comparison to the original.


-Inspiration (World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression) (100CP)
        Ideas crash like thunder through a genius' life every moment of their lives, barely contained, often barely understood. This is Inspiration, the illumination within, the raw stuff of genius. The greater a genius' Inspiration, the more power of creation and destruction she possesses. But there is a cost. As a genius Inspiration increases, she becomes less able to understand mundane concerns. She struggles to hold onto her Obligation, as people seem more like systems to be explored than individuals with their own lives and concerns. As she becomes almost godlike in her perspective, she must focus to concentrate on the mortal world and its concerns. As your Inspiration grows the buring power of Mania grows with it. All Genii start with a free purchase of Inspiration, Lemurians get three purchases free. It cost 100 CP to upgrade Inspiration. Your Inspiration can not exceed 10, free purchases included. In addition to all of this you will suffer from the Jabir for the entirety of of the Jump. As a genius grows more powerful, his Inspiration shines out of him to illuminate the world. This can be a curse for those mad scientists who want to look more "scientist" than "mad." The genius' Mania begins to tamper with perception and procedure, skewing any attempt to engage in normal science or to perform normal experiments. Though the genius himself suffers no penalties, the odd effects from his perception "cancel out" when brought into conjunction with the odd effects from his behavior he struggles to communicate his ideas to others. Modern geniuses call this "technobabble" in an attempt to soften the horror of the phenomenon, but it's formally known as Jabir, a sudden, paralyzing loss of clarity and coherence when a genius interacts with a regular mortal.
        * Can be bought 10 times, 100CP each time.


-Magitek (Diabolical) (100CP)
        Rather than being based on technology, you may change your theme to being based upon magic, sorcery, or other metaphysical terms such as divine blessing. Rather than lasers your goons might use magic staves, instead of hover tanks you might have supernatural creatures with durability and power to match. At least you don't have to worry about power sources or that pesky physics thing getting in the way. This can also apply to a magic-based sci-fi theme, hence the name. You have sufficient expertise in your newly chosen theme that you can create and invent within the confines of it, at the level of a true master. Even if you don't have previous experience in it, this will grant you all you need.


-Apparatus (Mage the Ascension - Panopticon) (200CP)
        You have a knack for creating and using tools to solve problems. Implants, weapon systems, manufacturing facilities, all sorts of technology; you know how to take the basic principles of the universe and put them to work. Along with an intuitive grasp of how to use any technologies you encounter (though not necessarily how they work), if you understand an ability, you can create an apparatus to replicate that ability using its own physics. If it's not something you yourself can do, you might need some assistance or 'assistance' from someone or something which can, but as long as you have that and understand the base principles, you're good to go.


-Doll Maker of Bucuresti (Touhou) (200CP)
        Being an indisputable genius in terms of mathematics and science in a realm ruled by magic tends to undermine just how impressive it is. Your ability with technology and engineering is so great that you are able to adapt to handling, repairing, modifying and even reverse-engineering completely foreign devices you have little to no background on. Your connection with both practical technologies along with magic allows for you to eventually unlock the secrets to creating magitech if given enough time to experiment.


-Hardcore Materialist (Mage the Ascension - Panopticon) (200CP)
        Everything is stuff, or built out of stuff. You can create things that disregard all that nitty-gritty through abstraction layers, but ultimately all those things humanity sees and values ideas, morality, etc. are an arrangement of substance. Substance can be analyzed and reconfigured. You may now treat various ephemeral or esoteric things as being essentially physical and material; ghosts, mental abstracts, divine essence, etc. Maybe not tangible with normal means, but material. With some practice, you can manipulate these substances and even alloy them with other materials, use them as computing substrates, or a host of other things.


-Moderately Peeved SCIENCE!!! (Mage the Ascension - Panopticon) (200CP)
        In the halls of the Etherites, scientific theories based off discarded hypotheses, alternate interpretations, and way too much enthusiasm are constantly debated, and tested, and 'proven' free of the constraints of the scientific establishment. And often, these theories seem to each work even when mutually contradictory, often in the same room. You've worked out how to handle such chaotic innovation in a way that is moderately stable. By attaching subsystems working off wildly disparate understandings of the universe, you can nonetheless make them function well together, with a bit of phlebotinum and GENIUS mixed in. This will never be as stable as putting in the same effort to make something based off an actually coherent theoretical basis, but it's close!


-Setup Wizard (Harry Potter) (200CP)
        You have a natural knack of melding technology and magic. You can easily jury-rig technology to work at Hogwarts. Your inventions could do considerable good for the magical world if they weren't all such luddites.


-The Mystic and the Machine (Marvel Cosmic) (200CP)
        The argument between mystics and technology is a faulty one. There is no need to choose one as they enhance and complement one another. Like a certain Mad Titan you have unlocked mastery of combining these two pathways to power. You can always find ways to combine any mystical knowledge you have with any scientific or technical knowledge. This differs from Fine line in that it is all about creating magitech. It also allows you to make a technological version of any magic you know, or a magical version of any technology you can build. All power sources between the two become cross compatible as well. Only fools choose one when they can have both.


-Technosorcery (Gargoyles) (300CP)
        Combining magic and technology is a no brainer for you. You can handily blend the two to create amazing effects like broadcasting spells over telephone lines or melding creatures together through sorcerous surgery. Very little in the field of technomagic is beyond your reach with this skill.


-Arcane Interface (Storm Hawks) (400CP)
        While many places and inanimate items are magical, magic itself normally requires a living thing to evoke it. Not so with this perk. You gain insight into creating a technological interface for magical items so that people not versed in magic can pick up and use them. Send a golem instructions through a PDA, or activate a portal with a TV remote. For those capable of magic, this Perk also gives insight into designing spells that manipulate technology, such as conjuring complex machines or altering computer data.


-Clarketech (Generic Space Opera) (400CP)
        Not only are you able to reverse engineer, extrapolate from, and eventually replicate with a device of your own make any technology you encounter, you also are able to do so with any other phenomenon, be it a physical occurrence, magical or even divine in nature, or even just theorised by you to be possible, though in the latter case you naturally will encounter failure if your theories prove false, in addition to research and prototyping taking a prohibitively long time to do.


-Clockwork Kingdom (Dark Souls 2) (400CP)
        Yeah working with souls and other special materials is great and all but you don't have that. You've got men, iron and a little bit of the old razzle dazzle. You know what? That's enough to fucking build up an entire kingdom and you can show that off. Near mythological abilities as an engineer. With a basic knowledge of sorcery and excessive skill with clockwork machinations you could create automatons that can follow simple commands, traps that reset and resupply themselves and self-maintaining machines. Although the things you make are marvelous in function, the most spectacular aspect of this perk is their sheer endurance. Despite the moving parts and small components, even when exposed to the elements and left unmaintained, unless deliberately broken they seemingly just keep working forever.


-Demigod Atelier (Asura's Wrath) (400CP)
        You know the secret science of Mantra technology, and can build custom devices that are powered by prayer or emotion. Further, you can enhance or upgrade items from other jumps to use this same power source. If you take Cyborg Hindu Godbody, you may construct Demigod cybernetics for other people. After the jump concludes, you may also build Mantra Reactors. Demigod Atelier allows you to create any mantra powered or integrated device, up to and including the vast fleets of Shinkoku Tratstrium, the heavenly vessels of the divine armies, and even the antiGohma platform Brahmastra. The latter however would require millennia of effort, and was never completed even in the scope of the original setting.


-Magic Marches On (The Weakness Of Beatrice) (400CP)
        Ground's Nir might lag behind Earth in terms of technology, but not for too long with you at the helm of scientific advance. Perhaps science isn't the best word. You're not any better at making actual computers out of sticks and raw metal but you are brilliant at making magical or fantastical versions of existing technology you know about. Vehicles powered by magic, calculating systems running on willpower, rocket launchers made with magical materials. Long as you know how to make the original technology, you'll be able to create a magical variation of that technology that is every bit as effective.


-Mind in the Machine (Generic Creepypasta) (400CP)
        Folklore is filled with stories of spirits, but it's only in recent years where they seem to haunt more technological homes. You know a few methods of binding spirits to technological devices to create things like haunted video games or video tapes. These spirits, in addition to the abilities you might expect from their kind, will also have a large amount of control over the contents of their home, altering footage or programming to sow terror.


-Pankosmoi, the Needle Grail (World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression) (400CP)
        A pipedream housed inside a house of smoke and mirrors. This is the hidden Axiom. With this the manifestation of a person's Mania could be pushed over the edge and into a real physical law, unique to this power, thus all things that were built by you within this Axiom are now real actualized repeatable phenomena unless you choose not to add in the element of Pankosmoi to the Wonder itself. Now the creation of Wonders is a true reality, a 'hard science' if you will. This also stacks with any other engineering or technological knowledge you have, letting you incorporate Wondrous features, such as the non-repeatable phenomena without Havoc or something to that effect, and update other technologies seamlessly into a greater whole of science. This uniquely affects the capstones of each background (See Notes) as well as provides the following benefited options to all Genius' Wonders: all of the Genius' Wonders are immune to the effects of Havoc, the Genius gains the ability to take an impossible fact of the world and create a Bardo with it, and finally the ability to destroy non-sentient matter to harvest massive amounts of Mania from Reality itself.


-Project: Black Book (Freddy vs Jason vs Ash) (400CP)
        With the existence of the supernatural, is it any surprise that science has advanced further as well? In secret labs beneath the capital, scientists work to unravel the secrets of the paranormal- creating machines to translate the Necronomicon, finding ways to open portals to the Deadite's dimension to retrieve Freddy Krueger, even attempting to find a way to replicate Jason Voorhees's unique condition. You have an increased knowledge of science that could make these things possible for you to do. Hopefully, you'll be a little smarter about it than Uncle Sam was.


-Stress Testing (World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression) (400CP)
        The working of wonders is an act of Inspiration. It is not so fundamentally buried in the ways of science as to ignore other outlets and some folk in the Hermetic Order of 28 Spheres has turned you to their experiments in this area. With this perk you will be able to find and utilize the Clarke Line, this is in reference to Clarke's Law that states that sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable from sufficiently advanced technology, to create technology so close to magic as to count as it. The 'science' behind this must still always be consistent internally but it can now benefit from things that would usually only be the prudence of magic, including perks. This means that magic and perks that benefit magic can affect Wonders as if Wonders were magic.


-Technomagical Gal (Smash Up Big In Japan) (400CP)
        Your magic combines very easily with technology, boosting and enhancing it. You can charm devices to run off mana, work with greater strength, self-repair and generally function better. It's so cool how you can use magic and tech both to do things neither could alone!


-Technomancy (World of Darkness - Mage: The Awakening) (400CP)
        Using technology with magic is not a new practice, especially since technology has existed since man first made fire, or tied a stone to a stick and called it a spear. While there are many other mages who purport to merge technology and magic, you do so with such seamless efficiency that it is nearly impossible to tell where technology ends and magic begins. You could tie the triggering of a spell to a computer program, having it take effect when someone tries to open it. Or perhaps you could use your magic to improve the quality of machines, increasing their speed, effectiveness and overall power. Perhaps you could even write out a grimoire, a repository of magical knowledge into a simple graphing calculator. Whatever you do, it will likely be creative and never seen before as the disparate disciplines are masterfully merged under your guidance.


-The Control Variable (World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression) (400CP)
        The Non-Repeatable Phenomenon, an impossibility that can only happen due to the presence of Mania, has but one rule that must always be followed; the internal continuity of the Phenomenon must always be consistent. Using an understanding of raw physics and the laws of the world as defined by the absence of Mania as the base of all of you experiments was an Inspired choice. You now have the ability to create a Control, a variable that can only change when you personally change, which allows you to change your Aesthetic to 'Real World Technology' but the more powerful effects are that you can use this practice to bind Mania to the idea of a wonder and allow it to be mass produced, though this doesn't allow you to stop Havoc it does make it so you could create functionally identical Wonders without a limit as mass production is a cornerstone of the modern technological world, and that you can, with an explanation of the process to work and maintain the Wonder, allow people to 'count as' Beholden, humans who through no Inspiration of their own slip into the worldview of a Genius and can use Wonders, for the purposes of not causing Havoc. You can switch between your chosen Aesthetic and the one provided by The Control Variable at will.
        * Designed to let you mass produce a form of magitech


-A Correlation of Constants Between Physical Reality and Wondrous Artifice Creation (World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression) (600CP)
        The work of a lifetime transcribed into your mind. The simplistic wish to have something real and valid in one's own hands materialized into a theory, not a Law, which by all rights should not exist as it does. All forms of Mania comes from the unknowable power of Inspiration but if looked at from another angle one can not help but to find themselves gazing backwards, after all even myths and legends usually have a grain of truth to them. Using a method of your own devising you have figured out how to break something down until you find the core idea that made it real in the first place, granting you an astounding ability to understand the working of something through proper physics. You can take any Non-Repeatable Phenomenon and translate it into a Repeatable Phenomena at the cost of exorbitant power and size upgrades. You have also reversed one of the eldest uses of Mania, the ability to power even mundane things as if with electricity, so that you can power your inventions on electricity instead of Mania.


-A Master of the Axioms (World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression) (600CP)
        Axioms are the 'channels' of mania that make the most orderly and understandable Wonders happen. The Axioms are not reliable, by any means, let alone consistent. A genius can imagine them as knots of cohesion floating in a vast illuminated sea of Idea, little islands where things almost make sense, though the shoreline shifts fractally with every passing second. Mastering each of the Axioms in turn allows a Genius to gain control of aspects of his own Wondrous works. A master of Axioms can do things beyond the scope of his fellows and has a true grasp of the deeper weirdness that comes with Mania. You have become a master of these powerful foundations. Most look at you in awe but you still feel there is further to go yet. In addition to this mastery of the Axioms allows you to utilize any other engineering or technological knowledge that you have, allowing you to make those types of devices as Wonders as well, enhancing their traits by doing so. Aside from the ability to create wonders from technology your Inspiration also allows you to see how the various technologies could be used together. Though this insight is small and it will take work to realize.


-At The Precipice of Magic and Science (The Death Mage Who Doesn't Want A Fourth Time) (600CP)
        At the precipice of science and magic there are untold wonders, imaginations made real through their power. Power that may soon be yours. You are a master of both science and magical knowledge, to the extent that the combination of the two is but a small affair, and though you are not yet an equal to the long dead hero Zakkart, with time you will be his match, and perhaps even exceed him. With time, effort, and study, it would not be unusual to see you creating technomagical wonders on par with the atomic bomb, or even greater things still such as the Root of Life, a material capable of healing any injury and even creating entirely new bodies by connecting not to the body, but the soul. This and far more fantastical creations will one day be at your fingertips.


-Atop The World (The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild - TG) (600CP)
        Walk this path carefully. This is the art that both saved, and destroyed Hyrule. You have unlocked knowledge of the greatest force multiplier the Sheikah were ever able to field - Large, walking, warmachines. You have a basic knowledge of the Sheikah's art of automation and robotics, with this alone giving you the knowledge to craft the small Guardians utilized by Shrines in combat tests, with the right materials. However, with enough resources and development time...you could create constructs that could even rival the 4 great Divine Beasts. This is the pure expression of Power...just remember that Power must be tempered with Wisdom, and wielded with Courage. Power without restraint is the domain of Calamity Ganon, after all.


-Cyber Sorcerer (Digimon World Re: Digitize) (600CP)
        No one would ever confuse you for a faceless technician; in fact probably quite a few people would be grateful for the chance to meet you. A genius within the fields of programming and electronics capable of not only preventing civilization from being flung back to the dark ages after cataclysmic disaster, but help lead it to the world of tomorrow one innovation at a time. A true peer to the great minds of GIGO, or perhaps even one of the brilliant minds that have assured it's domination of the tech industry world wide. However, such genius goes beyond the bounds of what might be considered 'conventional' science and engineering. While the creation of something akin to the Digitization Phenomenon Program would require years worth of concerted efforts between dozens of genius on your level; the creation of applications such as digivices capable of affecting the world, machines able to detect and interact with other realms, and the creation of self-evolving AIs are well within your grasp. Truly, yours is a mind that could usher in a new golden age for mankind; or its destruction


-Gear Formation (Gonna Be a Twin-Tail) (600CP)
        The secrets of Affinity technology have been unveiled to your eyes and to your mind. You are able to create and even modify the Gears that are powered by Affinities and to use Affinities to power or alter other technology as well. Gears are created by a special process that requires the investment of one or more extremely strong Affinities on a permanent basis, so try not to use one of your own Affinities. You can also use Affinities to grant unique effects or powers to other things that you craft, investing them into the project to grant it an 'enchantment' based on what Affinity was put in, similar to the unique powers that Ultimaguil members often wield. With a bit of work, you can even use any important part of a monster as a substitute for this, sacrificing organs like a heart or brain of some monster to grant a unique ability to something that you are creating.


-Magitech Master (World Seed) (600CP)
        If you looked at Neolife's technology for only a bit, you'd be surprised to see that it is not technology at all. Well, not pure technology at least. Rather, the technological standard in the game is magitech, a fusion of magic and technology. And it looks like you've taken a shine to this kind of thing, evident by your new skillset.
        First of all, you are able to build a technological equivalent of any magic or other supernatural ability, like a Psychic power, and vice versa. If you could cast a basic fireball or lightning bolt spell, you could build a gun that can do the same. If it's something more complex than that, for example a whole skillset like fire magic, you might instead be able to build a nanite swarm or a glove that could grant it wholesale to other people, or a robot innately able to do it.
        The same goes for any technology you are able to build. If you had a device at your hand that could stabilize space in a radius, preventing any dimensional shenanigans, you'd be able to create a spell that could do the same. And if you studied a space ship, you could create a spell that would let you travel the void unhindered at the same speed and with the same protection.
        But of course, you are also able to make actual magitech, using the strengths of both fields to negate their weaknesses and make something surpassing what you could do just using one of them. Whether it is space ships powered by magic and enchanted to be far sturdier and more powerful than their material makeup would suggest, ships powered by white holes that are contained through magic, warp gates allowing for unmolested travel throughout the galaxy once they are set up, or bombs that break open rifts to subspace, capable of easily scorching a planet through mana acting like antimatter rushing out of them, there's no technology to be found in Neolife that is beyond your ability to create.


-Magitek Mastery (Final Fantasy VI) (600CP)
        In essence, magitek is simply the use of magical energies as a power and fuel source for technology. Your understanding of that outstrips anyone else, and you can now apply this principle to any technology you own.
        By altering your devices to use something magical in nature, such as a magicite stone, an enchanted item, or just raw magical energy, you can enhance it in every single way and give it unique properties. A suit of armor would become much harder, lighter, and more agile than before, perhaps even boosting the physical abilities of the wearer in line with the magical power source.
        From there, the armor could make more esoteric uses of the magic, such as casting spells on its own based around the sort of magic infused into it automatically or at the wearer's prompting. This isn't some measly effect restricted to the mundane or basic, no, magic can be infused into any sort of technological device to enhance its functionality and give it a partially magical nature and powers.
        Even life may be infused with magitek technology like this, not only as cybernetics but directly as well. In this situation, it behaves a bit differently. The magic integrates itself into their body, becoming a natural part of them, allowing them access to that magic system and enhancing them physically, but they must grow into it. They start at a much weaker level, where they have to practice and develop their connection to this magic to realize it fully.
        There's no upper limit to them beyond what the magic's system is capable of, but it can take time, and you can instead choose to infuse living things with a larger amount of magic to grant them greater magical ability much more quickly. Unfortunately, this can have dangerous side effects, as giving them too much to handle at once can lead to mental instability or even insanity, the severity rapidly scaling upwards the more initial energy put in.


-Man Made World (Fate/Grand Order) (600CP)
        When Nikola Tesla took the secret of lightning to humanity, he spat in the face of Gods and Magicians alike. He had taken the divine and made it mundane for the sake of humanity and that act gave him genuine, immense power. While some may point to the ridiculousness of his science becoming supernatural, one can't ignore the power that technology gained, especially against the supernatural.
        You are a true creator in the same vein as Tesla himself now. The technology you create is supernaturally empowered, becoming more and more so the wider spread your technology is in the world you are in and the more your technology advances that world. If you created and spread around the world the secret of electricity, which revolutionised the entire world, you would then be able to create electrical devices that allowed you to do battle with even some of the mightiest Servants in history. Your technology is also imbued with even greater power than normal when used against Divine opponents, as the Gods seem to have an innate aversion to the progress you bring..


-Mind of the Sun (Exalted - The Solars) (600CP)
        Many speak of the First Age and its lost wonders, forgotten and quietly waiting for the return of their masters. However, far too many fixate on what was and what could have been, instead of looking towards the future, and you are not one who has time to waste rummaging around old ruins for secrets. Your Exaltation holds many of the lost knowledge of crafting and forging great Artifacts, as well as lost sciences of the First Age such as biogenesis. You begin with the basic knowledge and fluency in Old Realm, as well as mastery of the various sciences and ways of crafting from the First Age, able to forge weapons, warstriders, and other items of legend to add to your own panoply. As a bonus, you know how to substitute magical materials for such items with their mundane equivalents or metals in other worlds - useful in worlds without materials such as orichalum.


-Song Science (Ar Tonelico) (600CP)
        Before there was Song Magic, in the golden age of the First Era it was discovered that three materials, Parameno, Grathnode and Ardel, allowed for the conversion of sound into magic. From this, came the Tower and all its glories - as well as the eventual destruction of the world. Long forgotten, you have a complete theoretical knowledge of the true underpinnings of Song Magic, Reyvateil biology and the Tower as was understood at the height of the First Era. With sufficient resources, you are capable of creating or altering reyvateil, and repair and alteration to Tower hardware, something it has gone millennia without. With resources comparable to a superpower, you could potentially could raise your own Tower or complete Metafalss.
        Song Science allows for the precisely targeted creation of energy fields and semi-permanent matter, such as fireballs, giant swords, force-fields or functional computer systems allowing a Tower to sing itself into existence from a seed. It can apply this to control the weather, manipulate gravity, create life, transmute existing material into new objects, broadcast power with no loss rate within its range, mirror a Halfblood's mind on the SH Server in real-time, convert matter into digital data and vice versa. It cannot create permanent matter, which is mediated by the Wills of the Planet allowing it to become a part of their body.


-Technomancy (World Seed) (600CP)
        Often hailed as the most innovative magic, users of Technomancy are capable of creating, controlling, scanning, and even assimilating technology with magic. And now you are one of them. But not just a normal one, oh no. Your talent with Technomancy can rightfully be said to be quite monstrous. Whether it is commanding machines to do your bidding with just a thought, probing devices with your magic to discover their functions and any possible flaws, or disassembling and reassembling them, you can do it all with contemptuous ease.
        If you trained a bit, you could of course also create your own technology to use, entirely through magic, as long as you have any necessary materials before you. Another interesting ability of Technomancy is its function to let you interface with technology and use yourself as a medium for information to be displayed. So if you, for example, wrote a program to let something pass through your Aura, such as the hologram function of your companion bracelet, you could simply use Technomancy to establish a connection with the bracelet and yourself.
        But your biggest talent lies in the replication of implants and other technological marvels within yourself and others. You could for example quite easily copy the aura of a camera and adapt your eye to mirror it, or do the same to the auras of memory banks and computers to enhance your brain. With your skill, you don't even have to worry about overloading your puny biological body by using technology that is too advanced.
        Beyond that, what you can do is up to you. After all, the potential of magic is only limited by its users ability, creativity, and skill. Though I'm sure that with your potential, you'll manage to go quite far in the rat race of life. Concerning technology at least, social skills are not included in this package.


-Golem Crafting | Machine Crafting | Stupidly Powerful | 17 (Dragon-Half) (1400CP)
        Golem Crafting (400CP)
        You have studied not only magic and crafting, but how to blend the two, allowing you to create golems using a variety of materials. These golems are powered and animated by the magic you instill in them, requiring a well-crafted form suitable for enchanting. The larger and more powerful the construct, the longer it takes to create. Your constructs are capable of what limited independent thought and action might be necessary to carry out relatively simple orders. This style of creating magical constructs is light on crafting and heavy on magic.
        Golem Crafting SP: Your connection to your magical creations is especially strong, which has allowed you to figure out how to summon any of them to your side with a few words and a gesture, no matter where they might be.
        Machine Crafting (400CP)
        Golem crafters make enchanted mobile sculptures. You consider this crude and inefficient. You know that by carefully designing and assembling all the moving parts, you can make things that require far less magic to power them. Not only are your creations more energy efficient, they are also faster, more versatile, able to follow more complex commands... And less durable. The unfortunate downside of building complex machines is that tiny moving parts are easier to break than carved blocks of stone. This style of creating magical constructs is heavy on crafting and light on magic.
        Machine Crafting SP: You have figured out space compression enchantments that allow your creations to have more stored within them than they should be able to hold. This allows you to pack them full of tools, weapons, extra cargo space, or mess with their designs in imaginative ways.
        Stupidly Powerful (600CP)
        You are an exceptional example of your origin, both mightier and more impressive than the ordinary. You gain enhanced versions of every perk you buy that is free or discounted for your origin. These enhancements are marked SP in each perk description. Unfortunately this also means that you draw a lot of attention to yourself, and are an interesting topic of conversation. You gain the Light Speed Gossip drawback for +0cp.
        17 (0CP)
 Your maturity grants you insight and focus, allowing you to craft constructs that are far more powerful than before in a fraction of the time that it used to take you to build your old weaker ones.


 --- Domain: Quality: Appearance (32) (25 Perks) --- 




-Pure Art (Destiny - Old) (0CP)
        The visual arts may not be your thing, but that doesn't mean you can't be good at it. With this, you will be able to adorn any object you possess with paint or some other kind of marker and make it look good. You can paint armor, vehicles and weapons. Depending on what you portray, it could evoke different emotions. From fear to inspiration. You must have some skill at drawing or painting, and something to draw or paint with.


-Transmogrification (World of Warcraft) (0CP)
        Have a set of armor that you like? Yet you like another set of armor's stats? Well don't fret! Transmog machine is here! What is it? It looks like a giant washing machine, you can feed any two sets of armor (Head, Chest, Legs, Boots, & Gloves) and choose which one is spit out. The new armor will be the best of both worlds. It'll have the superior stats of the one item, and looks of the other. However the downside is that the other item is destroyed. However both items are in a database so you can always transmog the look. Don't bother taking it apart and trying to figure out how it works, because there's no answer. It just works.


-My Fashion Sense is Tingling (The World Ends With You) (50CP)
        You have an impeccable sense of fashion. You can make an appealing outfit out of just about anything. In addition, you will always have an innate knowledge of what is fashionable in the area wherever you go, allowing you to remain on top of your game no matter where you are. In fact, you'll usually be a trendsetter.


-Aesthetics (Anno 2070) (100CP)
        Others may be able to do what you do, but you? You make it look GOOD. Really, REALLY good. All buildings you construct now have a distinctive architectural flair that marks them as yours and yours alone. Even a simple wooden shack you build will have people nodding matter-of-factly and recognizing the design like a nation's flag, if they've had experience with you before. In addition, purely aesthetic construction - landscaped bays, parks, covered walkways, promenades - are not only cheaper to build, but require little to no upkeep.


-Aesthetics (Terraria - Journey's End) (100CP)
        It's not enough to just be able to make things, if you can't make them look good. You now have a true talent for design work and layout, capable of mentally visualizing complex structures and working out how best to match your mental vision, without sacrificing things like structural integrity. This also applies when making things on a smaller scale, allowing you to alter the design of objects to add aesthetic flare without compromising their function.


-Aesthetics and Flair (Bayonetta) (100CP)
        A gun isn't quite a gun until it LOOKS good, you know? It's supposed to be classy, make you look amazing just for having it. Likewise, that sword could use a bit of badass styling to it. When you create your weapons, you can make them look DAMNED good even on an off day. Expect any weapon creator to envy you, and those who die by your weapons to count themselves lucky as they perish to such beautiful art.


-Artiste (Girl Genius SB) (100CP)
        From acting to painting, there's a lot of call for people like you around here! Simply put, you have the skills and talent to be one of the greatest, finest artists of all time. Not just in any one field either. Your talent is boundless and unbelievable at everything remotely art-related you do. With the slightest effort, you could be a scintillating star in all fields from writing, painting, singing, underwater basket weaving... er, you get the idea. Crowds throng to listen to a concerto from you, and books you write may well cause knife fights between people wanting to buy them!
        Such is your talent that in but a handful of months you could become a celebrity every bit the equal of the Queen of the Dawn, or any other celebrity you've heard of. This also makes anything you do look unbelievably good, from your fighting which looks like a dance, to your clanks which all look like Things of Beauty and Grace even when stuffed chock-full of firepower.


-Artistic Architect (Halo - Forerunner Saga) (100CP)
        Forerunner structures are not simple. Even in the worst of times, there is a beauty to their layout. Patterns woven into walls, shining pillars reaching to the sky, and shimmering glass panes adjourning corridors. Forerunners don't just build big. They build artfully. Like so many other Builders, you have an eye, and a hand, for beauty in construction. From the most simple of floors, to the most terrifying of weapons, you can spruce them up so that they are breathtaking to behold.


-Bling of War (Macross) (100CP)
        It's one thing to have a weapon or vehicle of mass destruction, capable of rending an entire ground force or a squadron to shame. It's another to make it look so damn good your enemies would not dare get near it if they had a lick of sense. By purchasing this perk, you can design your equipment to look much more stylish and carry a 'theme' you prefer. This can range from the clothes you wear, to the weapons you wield, to even the vehicles you pilot into battle. It's all about style


-Brass and Vacuum Tubes (Smash Up) (100CP)
        You can make perfectly functional devices with a steampunk aesthetic. In fact, machines you build like this tend to work a little better, and stand up to far more abuse.


-Decadence (Dune) (100CP)
        You have the skills to sacrifice neither form nor function when you design, create, or arrange things, which is especially important in a society whose upper crust values opulence the way this society does --after all, the Emperor's throne is carved out of a single massive gemstone. Whether it's interior decorating, crafting a knife or sword, building furniture or a vehicle... you can make it appeal perfectly to the most crass or the upper crust. You can also figure out the optimal decor for any purpose or environment, which includes the best places to hide discreet surveillance devices


-Heart's Desire (Warhammer Fantasy - Tomb Kings) (100CP)
        All Necrotects are skilled architects and designers. They wouldn't have the job if they weren't and you're no different. You're gifted with any sort of architecture, trap making or monument designing. What makes you special is that you have a sense for what your customers really want. You can picture in your mind the exact ideal of the thing they're hiring you to build and create it. Closer than any instructions could communicate to you, you understand their wish and you know what it should look like, though the construction of such a thing may yet be beyond your means. Still, if you can carry it out, they'll love you for it, even if it differs from the instructions they said to you.


-Her Majesty's Majesty (Fate/Legends - Empire of Antiquity) (100CP)
        They say that every hero of these times was a marvel to look upon. The statues that remain from these years in modern times would seem to give that impression and should you eventually have one made of you, it won't fall short. Whether it's being beautiful or handsome, you stand out like a shining jewel even among heroes. Many can't help but gasp once they see your visage and it'll smooth out plenty of problems for you, not the least is finding a suitable partner. Your beauty will also affect the things that you make and rule over, even something as large as Rome itself, but this effect slowly takes hold over time. While a sword you wield may slowly become more ornate and fine over days of use, an empire might need years to be fully affected, but it and all it's people will be shining by the end. You can have this stop at a certain level if you like, whether that's to keep some parts of your empire ugly or just to stop everyone from maybe becoming self-obsessed snobs that never stop looking in mirrors.


-Stylish Mechanic (Gurren Lagann) (100CP)
        In addition to knowing how to repair and create mechanical devices you also have quite a knack at making anything you work on look good. Any time you fix something it'll end up clean and pleasant to look at, and you can easily come up with humorous or awe-inspiring designs for vehicles and devices.


-Tailor Made (Career Model) (100CP)
        You are a brilliant designer and can ensure objects you create are always looking fantastic, aesthetically pleasing and the like. Making something look good no longer takes any time or effort- you can focus entirely on function, and whatever you make will look outstanding


-Virtuoso (World of Darkness - Demon the Fallen) (100CP)
        There is nothing sexier than an artist. Music, painting, singing, you are a veritable virtuoso when you put your mind and faith into your work. Your emotions flow into musical pieces in ways that incite that same emotion in those that hear it. Those that look upon your art understand the deeper meanings of it almost instinctually, but it might always feel as if there is something they just can't grasp about it, something more. In some way, they can feel your divine touch by just experiencing your art.


-(Not so) Consistent Technology (World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression) (200CP)
        The average Genius has an Aesthetic that they fit into, kind of like a genre of legacy. You however, thanks to your many teachers, have a difference of opinion that makes you unique, Wonders built in your Aesthetic don't just 'feel' better but are better and you can switch your Aesthetic when you feel like a different Tech-Genre could be viable. You could have an airship that was built with the hard bulky like of a dieselpunk whilst the insides have the sleek holograms and AR of a cyberpunk.


-Beauty in the Arts (God of War) (200CP)
        The Greeks and their gods have an eye for the aesthetics of their surroundings. Whether it is the statues around them, or the floors they walk upon, or the things they carry and wield, it is better if it is appealing. Your ability to design any of your crafts has increased with this knowledge, able to appeal to form without sacrificing function. Regardless of what you create, it's going to look good enough that the gods might take notice... might. Whether this is a good thing, or a bad thing is for you to decide.


-From Q With Love (Smash Up) (200CP)
        Taser in the keyfob, laser in the watch, grappling hook pistol that looks like a cellphone? You are the undisputed master at disguising weapons and espionage gear as ordinary items. Just try not to get them confused with the real thing, and do bring the car back in pristine condition.


-Perfected Calligraphy (Exalted - The Infernals) (200CP)
        Elloge is a writer and storyteller without peer, ever creating within herself new vortices of vocalization and tangles of text. Her inner worlds reflecting manifold different tales and countless chapters of her own narratives. The deepest parts of her have little to do with reality as it is or ever was, idealized paradises and grand dramas unfolding in realms that resemble Creation, Malfeas, lost Zen-Mu, or any number of other, fictional worlds. So too may you craft elaborate narratives and uniquely beautiful stories, ever writing with the zeal of inspiration, and muse-born linguistics that would stand out even in the countless annals and libraries of Hell. From now on, you shall live and breathe the ingenuity of a talecrafter without peer. Appropriately to the wondrous correspondences you shall write, you will also gain the calligraphic skill to write with neat flowing script or ornate glyphs in all the numberless languages of the Sphere of Speech.


-Ancient But High Tech (Cities of the World) (600CP)
        You are an expert in making advanced technology out of lower tech items, and of integrating technology seamlessly into society. Technologies you introduce will be less disruptive and be adopted easier, and are harder to replicate. Not only that, but you've become a virtual genius in making technological items look like nothing of the kind. Scanners that look like mirrors, tables that are computers, stone idols that are forcefield generators. Of course, this makes you extremely good at spotting when others have done exactly the same thing and working out how such devices operate.
        As a city, your people are well versed in such integration of form and function, able to seem quaint and harmless while being nothing of the kind. People will constantly underestimate your people as being uneducated hicks and rubes who can't possibly be advanced as modern folks... though this effect isn't enforced and if you show it to be wrong too often, more intelligent people will learn otherwise. Any area under your influence will accept new technology and innovations extremely rapidly and with a minimum of fuss.


-Bring it to Life (Generic Video Game Developer) (600CP)
        Your art is transcendent in more ways than one. Any artistic design that you make is like a story of its own, each drawing worth a thousand words and every expression displaying the exact emotion you intended. Your ability is such that you can make drawings that could be mistaken for photographs, even when inspected by experts, and any animation you make is smooth, aesthetically pleasing, and looks natural. Nearly anything you make, even those drawn on a napkin in just under a minute, are so awe inspiring that that napkin drawing could inspire an entire franchise if shown to the right people.


-Legendary Master: Artistic (Rimworld) (600CP)
        You're an expert at expressing the inner beauty of any medium. It is mere childsplay to make anything you manufacture fit an aesthetic theme, regardless of function. Any dedicated statues, paintings, sketches etc. you make are vastly improved in quality, regardless of what you actually used or created. A water-colour paint-by-numbers on old parchment showing a gerbil giving birth would still possess beauty if filled by you. Also allows you to find a market for your artwork in any setting, allowing you decent income based upon quality of work. If there exists no parties to purchase such things, I'll buy them. Put them right up on my cosmic fridge.


-Lucid Logo Designer (City of Angles) (600CP)
        Design, iterate, redesign. Undo. A different approach. When it comes to graphic design, you certainly have an eye for aesthetic that can't be beat. But your best work is done without a specific goal in mind, idle adjustments to a logo intended for nothing in particular. As time passes, you'll note that it starts to look less and less like a logo at all. And indeed, it isn't. What you are pulling from the depths of your subconscious and laying on the page is a map, an ever-growing and ever-more-detailed guide to the structure of reality itself, no matter how odd that reality might be. In time, you could put the entirety of the City of Angles to paper.


-Mural Inspiration | The Yellow Sign (City of Angles) (800CP)
        Mural Inspiration (200CP)
        Graffiti is an oft-maligned craft, a generally illegal one at that. And sure, the lawmakers have their reasons, but you're not some lamer throwing up tags on the bathroom walls. No, your art has a message. What message? Well, that's up to you. Regardless, when people see your art, or your icon, or your words scrawled on public facades, that message will shine through loud and clear. And if they're amenable to the message, who knows? Maybe it will inspire them to action, to go above and beyond.
        The Yellow Sign (600CP)
        Now this is a trick with a rather more...specific meaning. Not to mention a lot more vitriol. Normal graffiti is the stylization of words, to make sure the right people can read it. This is the opposite: a single word, filled with love for those you care about, and hatred for those who would do them harm, carefully constructed so that only the latter group can comprehend it. When they do, the message encoded within takes its love and its hatred, and forms a spike of righteous fury that slams through their cerebral cortex. In a single moment, excuses, justifications, and rationalizations for their misdeeds are stripped away. Depending on just how many misdeeds they've committed, they might be given pause, reel in horror, or even break entirely under the weight of their past actions.




 --- Domain: Quality: Design (33) (20 Perks) --- 




-Customized Weapons (XCOM) (100CP)
        You know that efficiency is number one, because waste is a thief. You know how to make the best designs better, and will ensure that the equipment in use is ergonomic, streamlined, and efficient.


-Hull Architect (Endless Space) (100CP)
        You know how to design ships. From nose to engine, you could draft up a functional space worthy ship. On paper. Putting all the pieces together maybe beyond you, but anyone who puts it together will agree, it's a mighty fine ship


-My Watch Doesn't Tell Time (Honkai Impact Third) (100CP)
        The further you stray from the intended use of a device's style or look the better a device it becomes by default. If you make a watch that can't tell time you could cram a ton of things into it despite it's relatively tiny size. The shape or style must be a recognized thing, like a watch or a phone in order to benefit from the boost.


-Survey (Green Worldz) (100CP)
        A simple little survey that, when filled out, reveals the ideal weapon parameters for any given individual. The default length is 239 questions, but the survey becomes longer and more comprehensive as your crafting skills and resources become more diverse. As long as a person fills out the survey truthfully (and they are compelled to do so when faced with this version), the resulting weapon will be a truly one-of-a-kind tool perfectly matched to their personality and fighting style.


-Weapon Modifications (Archer) (100CP)
        You design and modify weapons with flair, creativity, and skill.


-Wired Watchmaker (Arcanum Of Steamworks And Magic Obscura) (100CP)
        Long hours hunched over the machinery and books that define your profession have left you with a keen eye for detail. Your eyesight is excellent even in the occasionally poorly-lit workshops you frequent, and your mind has sharpened to the point you'll easily remember the details of any schematic you're trying to assemble. You can still wear that monocle of course, but this time, you'll wear it for style!


-A Legacy of Innovation (Final Fantasy X) (200CP)
The Al Bhed have a long history – spanning back to a time when their name was not even Al Bhed to begin with, but all throughout, they have been on the forefront of development, out of necessity rather than convenience. If there’s a task to be done, you can adapt Machina to do it – not that it’ll be effective for the job or efficient, but at least you’ll get an extra pair of helping hands. That has to count for something right? 
Ah, right, you do have to assemble it yourself, but no worries, you’ll get quicker at assembling Machina with all the practice you’ll get, of that I’m certain.


-ARTIFICER (PREY) (200CP)
        Any monkey with a wrench can look up the technical manual and do a repair. Well, maybe not any monkey, but you're certainly a cut above the rest. Any technology you come across that you understand the principles behind can be drastically improved. Either simplifying it to make it easier to fabricate or improving its durability or power output. Weapons, turrets, tools and vehicles can all be improved beyond their base specs.


-Lab Standards (Starbound) (200CP)
        You are comfortable around technology. You can deduce what complex machines do, at least as far as scientific principles go, and once you understand them, you can standardize them. Technology that you study can be converted into generic versions which may be weaker or less versatile but are easier to maintain and produce. You also can follow the most complicated techno-jargon as if it was plain English.


-Engineer (Super Mario RPG) (300CP)
        You're more adept at coming up with novel and creative objects. Any blueprint can be held perfectly in your mind without needing to draw it on paper.


-Counter Technology (A Certain Magical Index + A Certain Scientific Railgun) (400CP)
        Some powers or technology have weaknesses and especially those Esper abilities have one and you made this into an art on your own. You have a preternatural ability to create and invent technology to counter and neutralize any powers or technology that you have encountered or have enough knowledge off and make them powerless and useless. So long the powers or technology that you want to neutralize is running the same system, using the same element or working in the same principles your counters will work with all of them without problems. The technologies that you built are impossible to reverse-engineer without your consent even using magic or forcefully analyzing it through technology even if they are trillions of years more advanced than yours.


-Enhancement Mastery (Battle Action Harem Highschool Side Character Quest) (400CP)
        Just by looking at a piece of technology you are able to consider different ways on how it might be improved. Whether its increasing damage for weapons or decreasing power draw for components there is always some way to improve an item. This also improves your Valkyrie's Core innate ability to enhance items.


-Modularity (Generic Video Game Developer) (400CP)
        Hardware incompatibilities are a pain to deal with. Thankfully, you design your stuff to connect together like Lego pieces. You know just how to design and create hardware that is capable of being put together piece by piece rather easily, allowing you to create consoles that can have internal parts replaced like a PC. You can also design your stuff so that it can hold a host of attachments, like a VR headset that connects to your controller or a console with a built-in charging station. If you want to keep adding more and more, that's just what you can do now.


-Schizo-tech Expert (Arcanum: Of Steamworks And Magick Obscura) (400CP)
        Technology advances in leaps and bounds, which may leave the enterprising inventor with some compatibility issues. After all, upgrading the old model of steam-powered Automaton with an electromagnetic hydraulics system may give it the dexterity to paint works of art as much as cleave your foes in half, but that's hardly a success if the optical systems receive interference and rend your servitor blind! You've become exceedingly adept at integrating multiple kinds of technology, especially when the various parts would normally be incompatible. Using different energy sources, blending outdated design principles with the latest advancements of the future and more are all within your grasp. Incredible!


-The Next Step (DOOM 3) (400CP)
        The UAC is pushing the boundaries of known science, and it's no wonder that a lot of the Mars facilities are dedicated to cutting-edge and somewhat poorly tested technologies. After all, testing how exactly things work is one of the reasons we do science! That said, there's no reason not to push for the best possible results right from the start, and you embody this ideal and then some. You have become highly adept at developing prototype systems incorporating new fields of science, to the point your initial designs are usually as good as (if not better) than those others might come up with after two or three rounds of testing, debugging and fine-tuning. Likewise, you can glean far greater insights from any such development cycles you implement, meaning that this 'head start' is only going to get bigger the more time you put into your R&D. This Perk grants you a 50CP stipend which you may use in the UAC Equipment Catalog section found later in this document.


-Weaponization (Mega Man Classic) (400CP)
        Your understanding of machines is such that, given an ordinary lumber-cutting robot, you can easily rebuild and reprogram minor worker robots into trained fighters. A lumber-cutting robot becomes a dangerous axeman, and the equivalent of the average Joe for a robot turns into a deadly sniper. In general you are capable of making machines more powerful while retooling them to suit your purpose. That pipe dream of turning a workforce into an army isn't too far fetched now.


-Infinitely Customizable | Modular Designs (Dead Space) (600CP)
Infinitely Customizable (200CP)
        It's not that your guns are bad, by any stretch of the imagination, it's just that they could be so, so much better. And now you can actually do that. In this world, tools and weapons are aided by nano-scale circuitry, which leaves a lot of room for improvement, typically in the form of power nodes being welded into specific places to provide extra power to certain subsystems of the weapon, to increase power output, ammo count/efficiency, and even unlock special abilities, like setting enemies on fire, or exploding violently. As an added benefit, you also get the ability to break weapons and tools down into parts - specifically frames, tools, tips, accessories, and upgrade chips, see the Notes section for more information - and reconfigure them to your liking. You can even upgrade those parts individually using power nodes.
Modular Designs (400CP)
        It's always easier to make better things from better materials, and your knowledge of far-future engineering is top-notch, meaning that all of the things you make are all that much better for it. Aside from being able to upgrade parts, tools, and weapons further, and make better base parts for tools and weapons, you can apply the bonuses of Infinitely Customizable to things other than tools and weapons, breaking anything down into classes of modular parts and swapping them around to your heart's content. This nearly obviates every part of the process of retro-fitting older creations with newer parts, aside from the actual manual labor and time.


-Making Virtual a Reality (Generic Video Game Developer) (600CP)
        First came the controller, then much later motion sensing, and later still Virtual Reality, with the future holding untold possibilities. But not for long. You have the ability to design and create just about any kind of hardware imaginable, with such marvels as game controllers that shape themselves to their user's hands or real life holodecks being well within your grasp should you have enough time. This works beyond the scope of video game technology, as well, allowing you to make things like computerized fans that turn on above a set temperature, or things like self- driving cars.


-Sum of its Parts (Satisfactory Factorio Gauntlet) (600CP)
        You understand how to create expandable systems, keeping complexity low while still allowing for different materials or more production to be added in the future. Complex systems make sense to you. You can see the logic behind even the oddest bit of system design, and you can expand it if you find the reasoning sound. Finally, the bigger the system or factory you created is, the more productive it is. Adding more machines makes everything faster and more efficient.


-The Legacy of /m/ (World Seed) (600CP)
        Looks like you've watched a few too many anime of a previous century. Or too few, depending on who you ask. Nevertheless, seeing several mechas combine into one giant mecha has inspired you to develop a certain skill set, one that allowed you to take the concept of combination and run with it. As long as you have the time and resources, you can easily build things such as several spaceships that combine into one large mecha able to fight space monsters in melee, with its pilots linking their minds to fight as one, that will be far stronger than the sum of its parts. If you ever come upon a race with collective chuunibyou, I'm sure you'd find many friends in them.
        You can also build similar technology that is smaller in scale, like for example autonomously fighting swords that combine together for a devastating final attack, or something as advanced as nanite swarms able to transform into almost anything you could possibly conceive of. Furthermore, with some work you could also combine devices that weren't designed to do so, taking their best parts but leaving out their individual flaws to make something exponentially more powerful or useful than either of the originals.
        Somehow, you are able to do this without the end product ending up any larger, clunkier, or needing more energy. So making the most powerful gun you are able to build, but which uses up an inordinate amount of energy, and combining it with the most energy efficient one in your arsenal is a real possibility open to you.




 --- Domain: Quality: Durability (34) (25 Perks) --- 




-The Honed Edge (Pocky & Rocky) (100CP)
        With just a bit of time and polish you can restore any blade to its true sharpness, as if it were just crafted. Rust and tarnish to away with ease as well. Your tools and weapons are always in the best shape. SOME effort does need to be put into this care of course.


-Whether There's Weather (Satisfactory-Factorio Gauntlet) (100CP)
        If you built or designed it, it's weatherproof. What kind of weather? Yes. Snow, scorching heat, pouring rain, vacuum, hail, all sorts of weather. If a human could survive a while without a spacesuit, you tech will keep working. And maybe it'll keep working even if a human couldn't.


-Crude and Tough (Warframe SB) (200CP)
        While Grineer technology is ugly and primitive compared to their rivals, they are undoubtedly effective, rugged and easily produced. The latter is true for creations of your craft. Anything you make is both durable and tough, able to take a beating and function in the harshest of environments while being viable for mass production.


-Designing for the Armageddon (Empire from the Ashes) (200CP)
        Is a valuable skill, to those who understand such things. You have a certain gift, my friend. Whenever interacting with any kind of system, you have a preternatural understanding for designing things to be impossibly rugged and long-lasting. Be it computers, machines or even institutions, you always know the right redundancies, designs and methodologies to use, resulting in systems that can stand the test of time almost indefinitely. They might not rise very much further by themselves with just this, but anything you have a hand in creating will last for veritable aeons, practically indefinitely unless someone specifically and deliberately acts to destroy them, and even then they'd have excellent odds of surviving.


-ELDER TECHNOLOGY (The Culture Minds) (200CP)
        Some civs just build to last, and it is not unusual for Sublimed civs to leave considerable artifacts behind. Any technological device, structure or vehicle that you create has an effectively unlimited usable lifespan. Not even organic matter that is a part of the device will decay, or even undergo effects like proton decay over the aeons. They will still need expendable reserves a gun still needs bullets, a laser still needs its power pack replaced or recharged but that gun's moving parts never wear out, and that rechargeable power pack can be reused for aeons and more without loss of performance.


-German Engineering (Smash Up) (200CP)
        Everything you build seems just a bit more. More durable, more efficient, more precise. Call it a 10-20% difference across the board?


-Mythril Coating (Final Fantasy Dissidia) (200CP)
        In many realms throughout the rift, mythril has always been an element of reputable worth. With the powers of the rift however, this mythril coating has been charged somewhat. Able to be applied onto both weapons and armor, items coated with this will be constantly charged with magical energy. As a consequence of this, the affected item allows one to sustain energy draining forms for twice as long, and improves their power slightly.


-Reliable Invention (Kim Possible) (200CP)
        Anything you construct is only broken when used improperly or purposefully targeted with attacks. The items you create do not malfunction and are completely resistant to damage caused by regular usage.


-Built to Last (Assassin's Creed) (300CP)
        Whatever you personally build, be it handheld or architectural, becomes nigh-impervious to weather, rust and time. If it gets lost or buried, you can 'feel' it out too!


-Built To Last (Stargate Atlantis) (300CP)
        You probably took the saying if it's worth doing, it's worth doing well a little too closely to heart. You could build a city to last tens of thousands of years at full functionality or a battery that keeps its unused charge indefinitely. Mere time and weather will not erode your monuments, and your devices may lie dormant for eons, ready to reawaken at any time. It's up to you whether this is due to glowy space crystals (ahem, advanced materials science knowledge) or something stranger.


-Robust Engineering (Dune) (300CP)
        Ten thousand years of stagnation in technology is a very long time... and now you know how to apply the lessons of those millennia to the construction of anything you have. Mass production does not exist any longer and even relatively common items are made as if masterwork quality, because aside from obvious cheap items, they have been built to last longer than the person using them. Expect anything you construct by hand to be able to last centuries, as long as you take a little extra time while you make it. With the amount of time you're going to be around... you may need that sort of quality.


-A Monument to Time Itself (Warhammer Fantasy - Tomb Kings) (400CP)
        You built things to last. A monument to death that itself dies may have a certain appeal to more philosophical sorts but you wanted your monuments to last for eternity, so that everyone would look upon them and know the glories that your mind had wrought. What objects or structures you create, by your own hand or by your direction, will last forever. The passage of time and the environment around it will not degrade it or damage it or destroy it. Even blows against it, attempts to demolish what you have made, will see their blades break long before the stone you laid down does. Your creations are imbued with supernatural durability, though they will not last forever or be protected against anything, they will be proof against mere mortals trying to defile your art.


-Armsthrift (Fire Emblem: Awakened) (400CP)
        Your weapons just don't seem to break and you know how to care for them well. Even immensely fragile things are unlikely to break in your care. Guns won't jam and swords never lose their edge


-Built to Last (Nexus 2.0) (400CP)
        The things you create are much more resilient than they otherwise would be, requiring far less maintenance to keep in good condition and functional. This even applies to larger projects, such as buildings and farms, or more esoteric creations, such as Seeds for Seed Sorcery. On top of this, anything you build is simply built better, a sword will hold a sharper edge, armor will resist more damage, a cart will have a smoother ride, and much more.


-Form & Function (Final Fantasy XIV) (400CP)
        A while back, you overheard something your customers had said - about cloth and leather being insufficient to protect them out in the wilderness of Eorzea. You have to admit that they do have a bit of a point. Cloth and leather might be far more comfortable than a suit of plate armor, but functionally they protect substantially less. But maybe if you could use a different material, things might be different?
        The principle of this weave is the same as when you made inner linings. But whereas inner linings allowed you to split open layers in order to weave enchantments and magic inside, now you have folded layer upon layer with inlaid crystals to attain a weave that can withstand blows just as well as a suit of plate might. The amount of crystals you need for the process is substantial - but the magic is ultimately necessary, so that you don't leave a single imperfection which may ruin the final product, and also so that it doesn't end up looking bulky and cumbersome.
        Objects that you craft with the same principle exhibit durability several times stronger than what you would have expected from an equivalent of similar weight.


-Made of Nintendium (Generic Video Game Developer) (400CP)
        Nintendium, the master material, the adamantium of the gaming world! Exaggeration it might be, you do make people guess twice with how physically durable your creations are. Your consoles could survive being dropped from the top shelf, your phones could be stepped on without issue. Heck, taking a sledgehammer to something made by you might even leave something salvageable, if you put enough work in. Oh, was that not mentioned? The more time you spend designing something, the more durable you'll be able to make it without too much of a limit.


-Never Goes Out Of Style (Honor Harrington) (400CP)
        Sometimes old technology is not quite as irrelevant as people would like to think it is. Fission can be useful in the far future, and ground combat is never quite completely irrelevant. You have an incredible talent for finding new uses for old technology. Things you build are incredibly robust and resilient, while remaining extremely adaptable and amenable to being modified to suit new purposes. One thing the Graysons excelled in was environmental systems to stave off the harshness of their world's environment. You have an excellent working knowledge of their design, production, and maintenance. One might even develop domed cities.


-Plague Hardening (Revelation Space) (400CP)
        In the years post-Melding, much of the advanced technology of the Belle poque has been set aside due to the risk of infection with Melding Plague spores. Where once glittering near-autonomous volantors streaked through Chasm City's skies, now steam- and battery-driven cars grind along its streets. Where buildings could be grown from a seed and altered at their owner's whims, now they must be painstakingly built with labor. You, however, have developed strains of plague-hardened nanotech. Any advanced technology you build is vastly more resistant to the ever-evolving Melding Plague and similar viral and infectious agents which seek to subvert it, lasting for days or weeks of direct exposure before succumbing when a similar unprotected machine might fail in minutes or seconds. And when your technology's defenses are finally broken, it 'petrifies', dumbing down its present form and function rather than growing wild and further spreading the plague; able to continue being used for a more limited application rather than failing outright. For example, an infected fabricator might reduce its construction resolution to components larger than one millimeter, losing its ability to produce micro-scale items but still able to be used, rather than churning out a froth of contagious plague spores.


-Applied Phlebotinum (Honkai Impact Third) (600CP)
        You see that dumb dangerous energy over there? Yeah. You can build your machines to harness it. Most of the time. You're a master of unconventional sources of power for your devices, and the weirder and more dangerous it is, the stronger the resulting power is. If you could somehow hook a Herrscher into your generators you'd substantially amplify their power output to the point you could probably use a single one to make a continent destroying weapon. Just beware of the potential Phlebotinum breakdown. Please don't put any big red self destruct buttons on it.


-Extended Warranty (Ben 10 0.1) (600CP)
        Let's get real for a second: You are a scientist, not a repair monkey. You shouldn't have to teleport all the way from your home planet to fix something one of your assistants managed to break in the time you took your eyes off of them. As a result, your technology is now durable and long-lasting...you can go years without seeing a prototype of your creation before it actually needs you to fix it directly, even the most idiotic and primitive species being able to guesswork how to fix it even if they don't know how it works. Also when I say durable, I mean the universe could collapse into nothingness and that device of yours would still be floating in the empty void that used to be said universe. Point being, technology you create is both insanely durable and is easily maintained. Now maybe you don't have to handle everything yourself.


-Failess Mode (Satisfactory-Factorio Gauntlet) (600CP)
        When you design equipment or machinery, you make sure that it's designed properly. Your designs are far more resilient against failure than they would otherwise be, only completely failing when critical components are outright destroyed. Chain reactions where failure of one component leads to another failing are uncommon, and really can't happen by accident. More importantly, every failure mode is a safe failure mode. You could make an antimatter storage container that wouldn't auto-annihilate if power failed.


-Lost Arts (World of Darkness - Mummy the Resurrection) (600CP)
        The Cabiri form of the Great Rite would appear and disappear, be destroyed and appear again no matter how hard Horus tried. Now your works are similarly hard to erase. Any of your creations, from writings to paintings to swords are immune to the ravages of time and have a mysterious luck of their own. This luck causes your creations to avoid destruction time and time again though all kinds of contrivances and circumstances.


-Performance Optimization (Ragnarok Online) (600CP)
        Every adventurer has seen their weapons start to degrade and eventually it ends in a trip to the blacksmith with their weapons broken. For a Blacksmith, it only takes so many weapons before they would come to consider What if we could make a weapon perform well regardless of what condition was it in? Reaching a breakthrough was a matter of reworking what Blacksmiths already had. Rather than looking to boost the performance cap of a weapon, Blacksmiths looked instead to boost the performance lifespan: Concluding with the creation of a spell which will keep the weapon intact regardless of physical and magical trauma for as long as it is maintained.


-Steamflogger of the Century (MtG - Bablovia) (600CP)
        You are one of the greatest riggers the plane has ever seen. You assemble contraption like it was nothing, building one crazy machinery after the other. More often than not, your contraptions are so sophisticated that even despite using sub par material, these machines will never stop working. Also, you have a knack for building contraptions that build new contraptions themselves. Just don't cause them to take over the world by accident!


-The Test of Time (World of Darkness - Demon the Fallen) (600CP)
        Whether it was your job to place a single type of gem within the soil, to create a certain mineral, or to carve mountains that reach the sky, your works were never meant to deplete. Change form, perhaps, but never lessen from what they were. You remember the secrets of creation you once wielded long ago. When you create something from raw materials with your own hands and infuse it with your Faith, it becomes something far more than what it is. Though a sword will bend, it will never shatter. Though it may burn white with heat, it will never melt. What is that sword-shaped thing in that black hole? Your work of art, of course! As long as there is no automation or outside assembly, anything you create becomes infused with divine might and will never wear or break. A leather jacket you made an animal's hide might be able to catch a sabot round, but that does not mean it won't splatter the person wearing it.




 --- Domain: Quality: Efficiency (35) (60 Perks) --- 




-Creative Leaps (Lords Of The Night - Liches) (100CP)
        You might not be as good at putting in the work, or checking all the steps, or keeping up with the research. What you can do, is make wild leaps that are consistent with what you know, jump to simpler solutions, and causally realize more elegant approaches to what seems like complex problems. A smarter mind than yours might figure out what actually has to happen to solve a problem. But seeing that solution, you can jump to how to do the same thing in a tenth as many steps, as you figure out how one action can solve two problems, and set you up to cleanly execute the next step. And your solution will be more robust to boot. You're also more intuitive, able to pick up and realize things without ever knowing why you picked them up or realized them, and more creative in general.


-Efficient Electricity (Generic Video Game Developer) (100CP)
        Energy. Computers, being devices able to calculate AI paths while simultaneously rendering graphics for players to see, use a decent amount of it. Thankfully, you seem to be extra skilled in the area of computer electronics, able to make devices that not only use smaller amounts of energy for the same work, but are also more resilient than the average gaming device, able to handle electrical surges far better than most.


-REMODELLING (Medaka Box Abnormal) (100CP)
        Why be satisfied with just what you were born with when you can make improvements? Through a variety of methods of experimentation, you are able to directly improve the power and efficiency of living beings or inanimate objects by remodelling them. This can be as simple as making an animal not afraid of powerful people or as complex as turning someone into a powerful cyborg or bringing out latent Abnormal or Minus powers within your own brain, given you can use Remodelling on yourself just as easily. There's not much of a limit on how much you can improve someone but it will take more and more resources the crazier and stronger the changes you are making are.
        * Keep in mind the crazy and strong changes are comparative to a world with reality warping conceptual powers galore


-Spanner Hand (Revelation Space) (100CP)
        You're very good at fixing things...and, it has to be said, breaking them as well. You've a keen eye for the right places on a machine to do some damage; load-bearing supports, sensor clusters, stress bands in the hull. But the reverse still holds: when it comes to up-armoring something, reinforcing it, and ironing out any weaknesses, you'll find the optimal placement for those, too.


-Technical Expertise (Iji) (100CP)
        You're pretty damn impressive when it comes to all sorts of technical applications. With this, you can better modify your own weaponry, armor and augmentations. Or just be creative and accomplish tasks like rigging an elevator to catapult it's occupants into the ceiling, turning them into paste. Fun.


-The Right Tools (Generic Cyberpunk) (100CP)
        They can be hard to find, but when resources are hoarded and hard to come by you've learned to make do. You can easily improvise for tools and materials you lack by creatively using what you do have, even if that means using scrap to build the tools to build the tools you need. Even if you're lucky enough to have a fully stocked workshop or lab this will come in handy, as you'll be able to do a great deal more with what you have instead of needing to commission or build specialized equipment for every unique little thing. You'll never be empty handed and useless for long.


-Artist's Eye (Inception) (200CP)
        You've always had a keen attention to detail, but it's about more than just sight. Smells, sounds, if anything the dreams are defined by how they feel. Your skill at paying attention to the minutiae of your environment not only allow you to craft more intricate dreamlands for others to enter, it also lets you spot the details that truly matter. To some, an elevator is just a means to get from one floor to the next, even in the dream. For you? You might realize just what each of those floors represents, and how important it is that you know just what lies within someone's subconscious...


-Educated guess (Factorio) (200CP)
        Your subconscious mind works overtime to sort and fact-check everything you know, granting you a sort of poor man's precognition. In the field, your hunches are uncanny in their accuracy (but knowing false information can return wrong answers.) In the laboratory, this vastly speeds up your work as you quickly identify problems, test for the right thing the first time, and are directed to asking the right questions to find the best solutions. The more you know about a subject, the more this perk helps you.


-Excellent Craftsman (In Another World With My Smartphone) (200CP)
        You are incredibly talented at making things. What kinds of things? All kinds of things. You are simply that talented after all. Anything you personally make, or direct the creation of, will automatically be top-quality, and you never need to worry about making mistakes in the creation process. To get you started you may pick any four mundane skills related to making things, which you start as a master of.


-Facile Frivolity (Rimworld) (200CP)
        You know just how to use excess resources. This may seem somewhat oxymoronic but whenever you possess a surplus of goods, be it food, medicine, or some crafting good, you will know exactly how best to put it to use. Maybe an extra half centimeter of plasteel insulation will make it so your lightbulbs never burn out! Progress!


-Fixer Upper (Dark Cloud 2) (200CP)
        When they put you through an apprenticeship, the first thing they did was to tell you to take apart a train. Then put it back together again. Then they repeated the process, removing parts bit by bit, and yet every time you still managed to put the train back together. Eventually you've come to realize that you can repair things - all while removing any extraneous parts to ensure that the efficiency of a machine is optimized. Machines that you've tinkered with don't seem to need as much to work as others might.


-Innovator (Final Fantasy XIV) (200CP)
        You'll never make a name for yourself if you can't innovate - and sometimes, innovation requires you to take risks and make mistakes, even ones which might be catastrophic. It takes effort to gain experience, and it takes courage to put in effort - but you've also got a bit of beginner's luck whenever you start trying to produce something new. You're far more likely to succeed - and consequently far less likely to fail if you go in completely blind, but more importantly than that, you're not likely to come up with a completely useless product in the end.


-Insightful Analysis (Freefall) (200CP)
        Whenever you build, invent, scan, design, or perform a major repair on something, you have a clear and accurate understanding of it several decades in advance. The errors, issues, bugs, problems and so on that would be discovered with mass production and mass use of whatever item are clearly understood by you, alongside the fixes and preventative measures that would come into play.


-Master of the Forge (Monster Girl Encyclopedia) (200CP)
        You are a master at crafting everything from simple items to masterwork weapons. You need to devote considerable time to each individual item, but the resulting masterpiece will always be superior to a normal version of that item. You also know how to enchant your works with special enchantments, whether blessings that strengthen you in battle or curses that corrupt you.


-Nanocataylst Augmentation (Crysis) (200CP)
        The Nanosuit and it's successor was reverse-engineered from Ceph technology, and retained it's compatibility with their technology, beyond simple common protocols. It was also able to take in fragments of Ceph technology to decipher advances and take aboard specialized nanomaterials for its own use, making it stronger. This technique can also be applied to other types of equipment or symbiont, enabling them to take aboard fragments of other similar pieces of equipment to improve their capabilities. 'Similar' refers to technologies within the same general category. Rifles, Ceph Hardware, technology derived from a specific civilization and so on. Items may belong to multiple categories at once.


-Robert the Builder (Invincible) (200CP)
        You can seemingly build and organize anything with far less hassle and for greater results than most would experience. You are able to be the driving force behind projects large enough to affect entire countries or maybe even the world in its entirety. Somebody 'glassed' Las Vegas? Don't worry, you could lead a project to turn it into the world's largest and most efficient solar farm that can provide cheap electricity to Half of America. Some super villain messed with the tides the world over? You, with the help of some geniuses, would be able to successfully direct the building of a secondary artificial moon to set the tides to right. Truly, the sky itself isn't a limit.


-Well-Forged (Assassin's Creed Odyssey) (200CP)
        A misthios lives and dies by the quality of their weapons, and you have a particular edge in that department. All of your weapons and armor will remain in top condition with minimal maintenance, and you instinctively know how to take care of what little maintenance they do need. What's more, your weapons and armor will improve as you do. As you train and become stronger, your weapons will become that much sharper, your armor that much harder, without you needing to do anything beyond training or fighting. This effect can extend to non-violent tools as well.


-Deity's Weapon | Weapon Synthesis (Warriors Orochi) (300CP)
        Deity's Weapon (100CP)
        Naturally, your aura is not your only tool, and neither is it just for show. By imbuing a portion of your aura into a tool, you can turn it into a weapon capable of eating through physical and magical barriers alike. Naturally, as you're infusing a portion of your mystic nature into the tool, with time it will grow to possess magical qualities as well. With a sufficient amount of time passing, you could very well find yourself bearing a mystic weapon, one that has naturally absorbed enough mystic force to rival the greatest of magical weapons. With enough time, all that energy would be enough to make it a weapon of lore. Just don't expect it to happen anytime soon.
        Weapon synthesis (200CP)
        Out there in the Dimensional World, you might not be able to find a blacksmith, in which case, it would probably be good to learn the skill yourself. Forging a spear or a sword? Well anybody can learn that from any blacksmith, here we're going to teach you how to perform weapon synthesis. Yes, it's not blacksmithing as you would expect. So, that weapon of yours. It looks completely serviceable, right? Battle worthy probably, probably killed off great swathes of foot soldiers? There's no need to sharpen it, but what about its inherent qualities? You know that magic enchantment on it? Or that spell it seems to cast every once in a while? Our form of blacksmithing works on those innate properties and spells instead. We don't strengthen the exterior; we strengthen what's inside, and bring the potential of that weapon up even higher. That low-level ice spell your sword casts? Yeah, let's work at it until it casts a stream of frost. It's going to take a while, but anything worth doing is going to take time. Better live with that fact.


-Do One Thing At A Time (Dinotopia) (300CP)
        When you focus yourself on doing a single task, your skill and efficiency doubles. Material requirements are unaffected, but time taken is halved and quality is doubled


-Master Craftsman (Forgotten Realms) (300CP)
        You are exceptionally skilled at crafting things. At your worst, your results are masterwork.


-Mechanic (Ragnarok Online) (300CP)
        While the Mastersmith socketed and improved items, the Mechanic instead focuses on machines namely the mado- gear that they are known for. Their proficiency allows them to improve machines the same way a blacksmith might improve a sword, and Mechanics with extensive experience can slot machines to accept external improvements.


-True Balance (Earth Girls) (300CP)
        Despite how crude the raw materials seem, the finished weapons and tools of your work are perfectly suited for their job. A hammer you make of stone and wood is just as fine a tool as one you could make out of steel, and a stone spear cuts just as deeply as any you could make of carbon fiber and razor- honed alloy.


-Ancient Empowerment (Generic Buffy Fanfiction) (400CP)
        CAPSTONE BOOSTER. Just as the very first slayer was empowered with the essence of a demon, you too have been greatly empowered by an ancient essence. This empowerment comes with the obvious physical enhancement we see in slayers, as literally being a slayer is one way this perk may manifest, so it will come with the super strength, the durability, healing slightly quicker, general threat detection instincts, but that's hardly all you get. Your empowerment reflects your origin, drop ins and fighters get the aforementioned super strength, but sorcerers and engineers can trade this for magical power. You also get this whole Chosen One vibe going about you, such that ritual, magic, or mad science project that uses your blood is now twice as effective. Finally, by having this "chosen one" blood, your blood can be substituted for any blood seals meant for specific people. Your blood can open the Seal of Danzalthar even if you're not a vampire, your blood can substitute for lamb's blood in a plagues of Egypt type scenario, your blood can open (and shut) the gateway to Glory's Hell Dimension. This also extends to any item that's restricted by users or race, you can use anything you can get your hands on. You're just really special.


-Ambrosial Artificer (Macross) (400CP)
        So many moving parts, so many pieces to the puzzle. It's so... needless. The other tech teams are complete morons. That's why you've learned how to figure out the optimization of your complex machines like Veritechs. What parts you don't need, you find a way to do away with. What parts you DO need, you can use the now-extra space to improve and bolster their performance. Some will call you mad. But the only madness that will come from your work is the rage of your enemies and rivals.


-Behold Haxcalibur (Modded Skyrim) (400CP)
        Congrats, you broke the crafting system. Anything and everything you make, build, enchant, or otherwise create is now ten times better than it really ought to be. Make an ordinary dagger that does 12 damage? Now it does 120. Pick up an endgame weapon and enhance it for its supposed max of 200 damage? 2000. Guns that hold more bullets and do more damage, magic staffs that massively amplify your magic, armor that shrugs off OHKO's, potions that let you ignore 110% of fire damage, weapons with ten or twenty enchantments. And if that wasn't enough, you'll learn anything crafting related ten times as fast, just to blow the competition out of the water even more.


-Elemental Mastery (Monster Hunter) (400CP)
        Any elemental properties your weapon carries are significantly amplified by up to 50% depending on the quality of the weapon.


-Emotional Storms (Exalted - The Infernals) (400CP)
        Most forms of precipitation and rain in the Demon City derive from the Yozi called Hegra, the Typhoon of Nightmares. She collects the constant fog of dreams that rises from Creation and condenses them into her clouds, to dispense them to the rest of the Demon City. Sometimes, she lashes the terrain beneath her with cold sweat from victims of night terrors. Sometimes, she sends erotic cloudbursts or blizzards of fancy. Anyone who touches her rain and snow, sleet and hail feels the emotions and perceives the visions of Creation's dreamers. So too, may you now infuse your works with emotion and dreams, that all who drink from your hand, all who look upon your works, all who read you writing, all who hear your voice and more besides are affected by the emotions you choose to infuse. Delirious passions, mad fear, and ever-changing visions are yours to grant to all you wish. Such is the strength of these moods and visions that you could drive mortals mad with them, if you are not careful. Though those of stronger make, like demons, will delight in them and revel in the exquisite experience.


-ENGINEERING ITERATION (Sunrider) (400CP)
        The highly analytical mind of a prototype can always see a way to improve something. Even with existing materials and techniques, there is always a slightly better way for you to manufacture a certain part or lubricate a joint. The improvements you make to your devices are noticeable and potentially endless, but you quickly find yourself at the mercy of diminishing returns. You can expect the first 50% worth of improvements to be reasonably attainable and up to 75% expensive, but beyond that it becomes prohibitively expensive.


-Evolve Each Day (Green Worldz) (400CP)
        Every time your weapons are deployed in the field, you gain data. Data on what worked and what didn't, data you can use to make your weapons better. Even if you don't actually get a report from the user or recover the weapon from the field at all, you will still learn how and why the weapon failed, and how you can improve it to ensure such a thing never happens again. At least, not for the same reasons as last time.


-Green machine (Factorio) (400CP)
        You have a knack for wringing every little bit of efficiency out of a system as possible. Your machines produce less pollution, consume less energy, and work just a little bit faster. On a larger scale, you know how to create a well-organized factory complex that makes efficient use of space, your conveyor system minimizes transport time and is free of bottlenecks, and you easily account for future expansion.


-Inspection and Rework (Generic Factory) (400CP)
        Whenever you are assigned to deal with quality control, you find that most of the rejections are things that can easily be corrected and you never allow a truly defective product past your knowing gaze.


-Lathe of Heaven (Chrono Trigger) (400CP)
        We're always going to need weapons, so the way I see it, you might as well get good at making them. Now? You'll be able to give old man Melchior a run for his money. Swords, guns, armor, even sunglasses - if it's worn or wielded, you can make it a masterpiece. You'll also learn how to make use of any material, bringing out its best qualities and minimizing its weaknesses. You could make bone sharper than steel, gold sturdier than titanium, and take a legendary material nobody's ever seen before, and figure out how to forge it, what to alloy it with, and how to craft that alloy into an impossibly sharp sword or some amazing shades.


-Machine empathy (Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus) (400CP)
        Long exposure to strange energies and abstract thought inevitably leave their mark on a heretek. Usually these changes are debilitating or disfiguring, but you have only benefited from these alterations. A tiny glimmer of psychic power has awakened within you, one that will demand careful use and strict discipline to cultivate safely. As your power develops, machines will come to increasingly favor you, completing desired tasks without needing to be asked, performing faster and more efficiently. Machines in the hands of others will rebel when directed to harm you, guns jamming and sensors refusing to lock on. Many other ways to manipulate the mechanical will be revealed in due time, if you have the strength of will and ingenuity to discover them.


-Mechanical Master (Borderlands) (400CP)
        You are a master armsmith and roboticist. You can build and maintain standard weapons and shields with ease, and if you put some effort into understanding it you could probably make E-Tech your bitch. Further, you can make temporary Digistruct items, though they tend to explode after brief use. If you find the right components, you might even be able to modify good stuff into truly unique weapons; some might call them Legendary. Though for some reason they always look kind of pearly.
        * Has some other stuff but the main point is turning things legendary and them looking good


-Metamor Stair (Medaka Box Abnormal) (400CP)
        Evolution is a wonderful process. It made these humans that are so fun to mess with, didn't it? But sometimes you can't be bothered waiting a few millions years for something to happen and just want it now. Now you can with just a touch, force anything, be it a person or an object, to evolve to a new and better stage up to twice. A monkey could be made to become a man and then into an evolved form of man. A blade could be turned into a chain sword and then into an energy sword.


-Modular Interplay (Satisfactorio Satisfactory Factorio Gauntlet) (400CP)
        Anyone can just shove some snail slime in a tube and shove it into a machine to make it faster, but you can do so much more. You can create modules that can be installed into a machine to make it faster, more energy-efficient, more material-efficient, or some other such improvements. While these benefits do come with trade-offs, years of working with and designing and these modules will let you minimize and, much later, eliminate these downsides. If you don't take this perk, you will not get Factorio-style machine enhancement modules as part of your Satisfactorio Crafting perk.


-One Hit Wonder (Generic Video Game Developer) (400CP)
        For whatever reason, you have the ability to make some of the best games possible, using your skills to the fullest of their potential. Whatever game you make, and so long as you put in some effort, it will have a quality to it that makes it enjoyable for just about anyone to play, and if it gets big enough in the media and market it could easily be known as one of the best games of the year, and possibly even of all time. And despite the name, this isn't limited to a one-time thing. As a bonus, this is one of several capstone boosters that will boost any 600cp perks you have purchased to even further heights. Check the notes section below for details.


-Reforge (Terraria - Journey's End) (400CP)
        The Goblin Tinkerer has a special process by which he can enhance various items, improving them in a wide variety of ways, a process which he charges dearly for. Now you know the secrets of that process as well, and can use it to reforge your various items, granting them a wide variety of properties. You can either sacrifice things of material value (I.E. money) or can dump mana into improving the object. The cost in either case depends on how well-made and powerful the item in question is, with better objects costing more to improve. However, one benefit is that your process is refined enough that you can push the reforging to either make the item better or worse, rather than relying on random chance. That said, it is possible for a highly improved object to simply eat the cost and then not change at all, so there is still a risk.


-Secret of Steel (Historys Strongest Disciple Kenichi) (400CP)
        An illustrated guide created by the greatest master of weapons the world has ever known. It keenly details the techniques, methods and setup required to create weapons using traditional Japanese techniques. This text goes beyond that however, and if the directions are followed perfectly it can be used to forge weapons, armor, and tools that are far better than anything that could possibly be made even with the most advanced metallurgic technology. Objects created while still composed of steelwill be significantly stronger than steel and can withstand blows from a Martial Arts Master. Blades made using these techniques will be preternaturally sharp, able to cut through stone, steel and perhaps even more with proper strength and training. Such bladed weapons will almost never lose their edge and require virtually no maintenance. Armor made using these techniques is nearly indestructible and will never rust or corrode. Normal tools will work with such efficiency that even primitive tools can accomplish feats of scale equivalent to highly advanced modern technology. For example, a scythe made with these techniques could harvest an entire field in the same amount of time as a combine harvester or a simple hoe could do the work of a tractor towed plough.
        * Does not only work on steel, it works on other metals too
        * This is a low level cultivation setting, Martial Arts Masters can take on tank shells and missiles and destroy armored buildings in one sword swipe. So the new strength of items made with the help of this perk can be imagined.


-Tim Taylor Technology (Subnautica) (400CP)
        Power systems like nuclear reactors and solar plants produce double their normal output without straining the circuitry. Tools and habitat fixtures may be put into overdrive, increasing effect at the expense of efficiency. While in a vehicle, you may redline the engine, doubling its speed for sixty seconds. Overdrives and redlines drain power very quickly, and will damage components if overused.


-Touch of Improvement (A 'Happy' Harry Potter fanfiction ) (400CP)
        Charity can sometimes be slow to change the world simply because it's impossible to help everyone without burning out, unless you have the means to affect multiple people at once that is. This is not that perk exactly but with it you can target important places and buildings to give them three types of improvement in utilities, atmosphere,and security. Utilities targets the things in that category from electrical wiring and plumbing to the appliances and furniture, Atmosphere focuses on how friendly the place is and whether people find it easier to relax or focus, Security takes care of all the protective stuff from enchantments and animated armor to metal detectors and locks. Three things can be improved in each category after which you'll have to make any changes yourself manually. Perk does not provide improvements in the form of people such as adding human guards for security.


-Diamond Techniques (Summon Night Swordcraft Story) (500CP)
        Hoo baby, now you're cooking with gas! These are the same techniques used by Craftlord Rondeau, the Diamond Craftlord of Wystern! This means whatever you make is now in addition to being top of the line in performance, also top of the line in looks! If you have this perk as a Craftknight, you're likely to be a Craftlord yourself. If you're an Apprentice, you're likely to be considered the second coming of Craftlord Shintetsu just like Cleru or Pratty! This perk acts as a Capstone Booster for the Drop-In, Apprentice, and Craftknight Origins.


-A Gilded Bow (Horizon Zero Dawn V0.9a ) (600CP)
        Be it a Lodge War Bow or a golden gun, the more invested the aesthetics of your weapon, the more efficient, accurate and deadly it becomes. What for others might be only usable as a trophy weapon is for you a weapon twofold as deadly as its undecorated cousins.


-A Mind of its Own (SB Dragon Ball Z) (600CP)
        Obeying orders is one thing, but sometimes a situation may evolve past your orders, and you're no longer there to give new ones. With this, your creations gain a sort of sixth sense that alerts them to what you would like them to do in a given situation. Even when you're not anywhere near them, or dead, they'll still carry things out in a way that you'd most approve of. This also eliminates any issues where your creation will decide to do something for your own good. This isn't the only type of evolution that occurs however. As years pass they will become more efficient, stronger, and overall better. An android you build with the capability to fight a low level Saiyan could easily grow to challenge Vegeta within a few years. One that could fight Frieza may find itself reaching Majin Buu's level of power after half a century or so.


-Chosen of Death (Lord of Light) (600CP)
        Great Yama, Death-god, has seen you clearly and bade you enter the Vasty Hall of Death, to serve as his partner in creation. Not merely revealing his secrets of science -you are his equal in the arts. Your creativity is that which may forge ten unique treasures each day, or mass produce legends. Design of all forms of weapons, armors, vehicles, and utilities comes to you with blinding light and strength of inspiration. With this position comes the virtual guarantee of rebirth in your next life, as a Demigod of the forge.


-Craftsman of the Gods (Viking Saga) (600CP)
        Things you make yourself from base components gain properties far beyond what they should. Belts that increase strength several times over or a spear that never misses are well within your skill, and you will only get better.


-Legendary Master: Construction (Rimworld) (600CP)
        You're an expert architect capable of realizing truly magnificent and strange buildings. You know exactly how to balance the weight of any given structure to prevent collapse and can utilize even the weakest materials to support whole mountains. You are uniquely capable of reproducing or near reproducing almost any large-scale structure given appropriate resources. If you know how to produce something you innately understand how to build the facilities needed to manufacture/maintain it.


-Legendary Master: Crafting (Rimworld) (600CP)
        You're an expert at the manufacture of goods of a truly staggering variety, whether its rolling joints, creating sci-fi tier ray-guns, or sewing a doll. The speed at which you create any of these implements is vastly increased and becomes shorter every time you successfully complete one. Every time you produce a copy of something you've already made it is slightly improved, a rough 1% increase in overall function. This stacks fully with successive fabrication though you must be personally involved in the process of creation. Roughly one in every 1000 of your creations will be Legendary, doubling all improvements from this perk and bearing a unique 'artwork' based on an event from your Jumps. Decided by myself, if you don't mind.


-Master Craftsman (King Arthur) (600CP)
        Thanks to being taught by faeries, anything you make by hand is a great deal better than anything regular humans can make. Armor is nearly indestructible and lighter than it should be, blades are sharper, blunt weapons have more force behind them, bows and crossbows can shoot farther and are easier to pull back. Even mundane items like baskets work better, though you can't give items mystical powers without being a wizard or something.


-Mastersmith | Expert Smithing (Ragnarok Online) (600CP)
        Mastersmith (200CP)
        The Mastersmith can socket items allowing him to add slots where modifications can be implemented onto items. While intended for cards, these can be used for other modifications which need slots if need be. (but effectiveness may be reduced)
        Expert Smithing (400CP)
        It's not just about creating the sharpest blade anymore. Improved items now have affixes on them based on how many times they've been improved. Each level will be tougher than the next to improve and require more energy/mana/souls, but the Blacksmith's smithing ability now has no cap.


-Material Synthesis Science | Exotic Compatibility (Gundam - After Colony) (600CP)
        Material Synthesis Science (200CP)
        You know a few things about getting your own materials, but you also have a bit of know-how about how the people here get such quality materials. Normally, you know how to forge, quench and mold materials into more high quality specimens, but you have a specialization in Zero-Gravity Material Synthesis as well-in microgravity conditions, you can create much more effective materials thanks to the limitations of gravity being removed.
        Exotic Compatibility (400CP)
        You have a way of working with quirky and strange materials-in your hands and machinery, it assumes the forging and abilities of plain Iron until you begin building with it. You also can integrate exotic materials into your constructions a lot easier, and if you don't know what a material is or what it can do, you're very good at researching applications and properties of said materials. This research could also go into things such as improving production numbers and similar.


-One Bajillion Science Packs (Satisfactorio Satisfactory Factorio Gauntlet) (600CP)
        You can use the research system from here to research small, incremental, quantitative improvements to one characteristic of a class of equipment, machine, or device, like +5% shooting speed for laser weapons, +2.5% top speed for ground craft, or +2% mining productivity. If something would benefit in the same way from two different types of boosts, only the greatest boost matters. (For example, with +35% handheld weapon shooting speed and +15% bullet shooting speed, the boost is 35%.)
        You may share the benefits with your Companions and Followers. All users of this Perk on the same chain share the same set of boosts that have been researched. This Perk can apply to anything the user designs, builds, or uses, and can be toggled or scaled down by the user. While this might not sound like much, you may research the same boost as many times as you wish. The benefit increases linearly, but the costs increase quadratically; the Nth level requires N2 times the amount of all types of research materials used for that particular boost.
        If you take this, then every delivery (of an orbital probe, 500-meter truss, or quantum-grade accelerator magnet) you make using a Space Elevator or Rocket Silo will grant you the research materials needed for this type of research, with each item delivered granting you enough of these specialized materials for the first level of research. You will need other types of research materials as well, but these are of the kinds you have already unlocked and produced.


-OPTIMIZED (The Culture Minds) (600CP)
        Newer isn't always better, and ancient does not mean something isn't advanced. In high civilizational scales, the musty old tech used by Elder civs cannot necessarily be improved on by those of younger, more vibrant species and in around 40% of cases, the older forms of technology win out over the newfangled stuff. Your stuff is almost always in that 40%.
        Unless something is specifically engineered to counter your own tech or an effect your tech produces, newer technology is likely to have holes that your older tech somehow gets through. Software designed to counter sentient viruses might let an old malware script you invented decades ago through; armor made to turn aside bullets and beam weapons might fail before the simple geometry of your knife blade...and should you slumber for a vast amount of time, the world you wake to will likely have forgotten what you are and what you are capable of, innocent to any of your devices that have been forgotten along with you.


-Reduce, Reuse, Rearm (Dota 2) (600CP)
        Again, and again, people assume science immediately yields results. That there is one final answer to be found, which magically brings about utopia. Many would disagree in what specific meaningless poetic way they prefer science as, but it is easy to see that the more one works the more results they may potentially attain. That's not to say dead ends don't exist, and that one can mindlessly bash their head against a wall until a new weapons design pops out.
        Either way, your methodology has embodied the constant march of science on a philosophical and practical level. You switch yesterday's capacitor for tomorrow's, yesterday's explosives for tomorrow's, every single bit of information gained from field tests and routine maintenance near-instantly analyzed in order to devise a new upgrade, meager as it might be. So it is, that a gun designed and wielded by your hand will change from firing rounds heard long before they strike to punching through a dark sorcerer's inner sanctum and striking them down before the soldiers outside hear it in a year of daily use. Channels give way to water wheels give way to pumps and complex sets of tubes as one realizes the imperfections in a system and creates a better method. While these simple refinements are surprisingly unhelpful in regards to the mystical arts and physical practices, a constant level of technological enhancement is incredibly helpful, even for one who lacks eternity.


-Resistance Ignorance (Elder Scrolls Skyrim SB) (600CP)
        In many ways mages are on top of the world power-wise. After all, someone can only get so good at swinging a sword or hammer before things sort of just stop getting better. Magic isn't limited like that, someone can go from throwing a fireball that engulfs a tree or two, to casting grand spells that can change the world or lay the groundwork for apotheosis. However, there is one primary issue with magic as a whole, and it can be summed up in two words: magic resistance. The power to rip someone's soul out is only good if it works, and it'd be quite unfortunate for you to attempt something of that nature, only to have some meathead barbarian bash your skull in with an axe because of some amulet or innate resistance. Now that's no longer a problem. An absolute resistance to magic is now nothing before you. Your spells and magical items do damage like they weren't even there to begin with, and that's if they had a full immunity. For those unfortunate enough to have less than full immunities, or none at all, they'll see your offensive magic becoming that much more effective against them.
        * Bypass magic resistance with your items


-Rubedo (Lords Of The Night - Zombies) (600CP)
        You can imbue your craft with perpetuity. For gross structure, you can form a half-real substance from Corpus and Gold that, when invested in an object, perfects and transcends that object. Afterwords, you're left with the perfected shadow of the transcended object. Such shadows resist damage much like lesser artifacts, and if they are somehow damaged will restore themselves over time. The shadow is also just better then the original untransended object was. It costs roughly five parts gold for every one part of the object to be transcended. For engines and other systems that need to be fuelled, it starts out costing as if to pay to transcend enough fuel for it to run all day to create a perpetual engine that runs on a common fuel. There is no good benchmark for all the different exotic fuels you might have, but it's safe to say that it grows exponentially more expensive the more exotic the fuel.


-Self-Made Shopkeeper (Recettear) (600CP)
        On the quest to stock your shop with truly unique wares, you've learned a skill to fuse items, on a level that no mere shopkeeper could manage by themselves. Anybody can sell a pineapple or a banana, but only you can sell a pinenana! Ok fine, it's actually not that simple. The Fusion spell taught to you works well on items which have the same inherent properties, in the case of two fruits, or two swords, and so forth. Shopkeepers can rejoice that the value of the final product is the additive sum of both ingredients, but only one item can serve as a base, while the other item is consumed. That pineapple that I used as a base for demonstration... well now it can be peeled like a banana. That's handy, right? For any item that this is applied to, it will retain a single trait from the sacrificed item. It's almost as if you were breeding items. On second thought that probably isn't the best comparison to be making.


-Transhuman Protocols (Generic Cyberpunk) (600CP)
        The things we could do if only every advance wasn't riddled with unseen dangers and hidden consequences. If they're smart they'll listen to you. You can take any technology or procedure that you understand and easily figure out the flaws, pitfalls, drawbacks, and unintended or negative consequences, and as long as you put in the time you'll figure out how to get past them. Whether it's ensuring cybernetic augments don't result in lethal rejection from the body, a gene-modification doesn't make the body eat itself from the inside out with cancer, or that a device to transfer a mind leaves the same person that went in and not just a copy, or just working out the kinks in something you'll find a way. The future is an uphill battle, and there won't be time to make it if you spend it stumbling.


-Minor Blessings | Unnatural Skill/Divine Child (Percy Jackson) (700CP)
        Minor blessings (100CP)
        For one reason or another you've got a god who cares slightly about you and has seen fit to grant you some minor boon within their domains. Choose one god from any pantheon and gain a minor boon from them. The god will care slightly about you but unless you go on to further distinguish yourself it will be more of a minor interest in your affairs than someone they feel the need to help (Effectively think a diminished version of one ability a demigod might have, think minor ones are stuff along the lines of breathing water, lucid dreaming, or appropriate vague extra senses, useful but nothing especially major). This can be taken multiple times.
        Unnatural Skill (200CP)
        Whether from your heritage or just being that good you've got one particular mundane skill that your feats which border on supernatural. Whether you're a smith on the level of the Cyclopes, a near prescient tactician or a swordsman who is nigh unstoppable with a blade your feats will be legendary. You are on a level within your skill such that only other beings of legend can hope to match you. This may be taken multiple times. You may not choose magic but you may choose a particular application of magic if you have it already (so curses, enchanting might work, more specific gets a bigger boost).
        Divine Child (400CP)
        You are the direct child of a god of your associated pantheon and gain various benefits from this. You gain lesser manifestations of your parent's domains as well as generally being better than an ordinary mortal. You may take most any god as your parent but to take one of the heads of a pantheon as a parent you must take the "Fate finds you interesting" drawback receiving no points for it (you can also do this with a lesser god to get greater powers). Generally this will give you insight into and some control over your divine parent's domains, a son of Poseidon for example can control water and ships, talk to horses, cause minor earthquakes and is empowered within water.


-Daedalus' Student | Titan's Blood (God of War) (1100CP)
        Daedalus Student (600CP)
        It is one thing to work on forging mere sword and shield, but it is another to create truly marvelous wonders... for a mortal. You could make marvelous wings out of bird feathers and beeswax, capable of granting flight to anyone. Or maybe you wish to create an everchanging Labyrinth, that shifts and alters itself depending on how it moves. Regardless, your architect and forging skills have taken a dramatic increase, to the point where the things you create just may have properties and quality they normally shouldn't have, albeit directed towards the purpose of your creations. Through your works, your will be known... but take care that the gods do not take offense with your work.
        Titan's Blood (500CP)
        What a curious thing you are, to have become such a thing. One of your ancestors was a Titan, a primordial being of great power and ability that was responsible with shaping the world as it is. You are not full-blooded, but the effects have been prevalent on you nonetheless; your size may be increased up to fifteen meters in height, with your strength as such that you could throw pieces of buildings one-handed at your enemies. You may also choose one Titan you are a descendent from, gaining aesthetic appearance changes similar to them. But more importantly, you may relax yourself and 'commune' with the world and nature around you; by opening your mind to the world you can learn about it and its secrets quite quickly, along with finding what is the largest threat to the balance of nature. You are of the planet, child. It is your birthright to know these things.
        * *Titan's Blood also grants access to the following boosts for capstones you've purchased:
        * 'Daedalus' Student': Your crafting has undergone a dramatic improvement, to the point where you can make incredible works with the strength of an army within them. You have also gleamed into a new type of crafting, and you can forge energy constructs such as Zeus' Lightning to be used in your wishes.


--- Domain: Quality: Resources (36) (63 Perks) --- 




-Acquester (Spiral Knights) (100CP)
        In times of crisis and desperation, resources become too precious to use on anything other than necessities. The spiral Order has had to save all their supplies to repair their ship, so you've had to make do on the field. you know how to look for your own resources, remaining self-sufficient in the field through using scavenged items as supplies for anything ranging from simple maintenance to complex construction. Power Cores, Blighted Bones, or even Goo Drops can be used as spare parts or more. With what you've learnt, these days you don't just survive, you thrive. Whether it's machines that power the Constructs or the way that Wolver's fur burns, you've learned to figure out what separates useful resources from useless refuse. The world keeps spinning, knight. Keep up or die.


-Backyard Handywork (Phineas and Ferb) (100CP)
        Who needs a massive machine shop or specially-crafted equipment when you have some plywood and a toolbox? No matter how complex or intricate of a project you might be making, you'll find that you can easily figure out how to substitute commonly available tools and resources for more complex equipment, and still have the final project come out fine. Also comes with a decent understanding of engineering, architecture, and a few other material science fields to help you get started on whatever projects you might want to work on.


-Coconut Tech (Bloons) (100CP)
        You are extremely intelligent, with such a great understanding of technology that you can supplement inferior parts for better parts as needed. The worse the substituted part is, the shorter it will last, but it will function perfectly while the part is inserted. Using vines, wood, and coconuts to replace wires, sheet metal, and batteries is not out of the question. With each building skill gained, you gain the ability to insta-craft a crude version of that building out of thin air.
        * Fort Raiser - Bark Barricade. A fortified wooden wall, twenty feet wide by six feet tall, with wood spikes along the top. Will last for eight hours before breaking down, if not attacked.


-Composition Analysis (Final Fantasy XIV) (100CP)
        "Before you get to work, you need to know what it is you're dealing with!" -that was the first lesson you were taught when you started this discipline. Certainly, your mentor was right. Without knowing what you're working with, you're simply courting with catastrophe. With a bit of help from the Aether tools you have, you can discern the properties of any material you're working with -enough to know if there's an occupational hazard involved with handling them. But with sufficient practice and a discerning eye, you can figure out what any item is made up of.


-Magic Rocks (Touhou Luna Nights) (100CP)
You may be familiar with gemstones as simply being shiny rocks. Here that is not the case, all gems in this jump have magical powers, and while they do not individually possess much power, they can give significant boosts when collected by the hundreds or thousands. By paying 100 CP, you can choose to take this quirk with you, changing gemstones in future worlds to possess small magical powers of their own.


-Plowshares from Swords from Plowshares (Warhammer 40k - Squats) (100CP)
        You might have noticed most of the best Squat vehicles and weapons are repurposed mining and industrial equipment. This is no accident, for not only do such things have to be tough, they are intimately familiar to operators and engineers alike. You have a particular genius for weaponizing civilian technology, and finding constructive industrial uses for weapons.


-Repair Savvy (Outlaw Star) (100CP)
        Your skills in mechanics are top notch. Your weapons, armor, and personal equipment are all easy to repair, and maintenance of all of them takes mere minutes instead of hours.


-Resource Management (Empire from the Ashes) (100CP)
        What can I say? You're an expert at logistics. You know how to extract the maximum possible use out of even the absolute least resources. A ragtag group of counter-mutineers managed to not only survive, but actually attack and make inroads into damaging an almost unimaginably better armed, equipped and numerous group. Just like them, you too can make virtually endless repairs, adapt low level-tech to interface with higher level tech, and in general stretch the usage of those resources far beyond what even the shrewdest economist could ever manage. Mind you, this is for people and tech most of all. While it will work on other resources, even magical, esoteric ones like mana and whatnot, don't expect remotely the same efficiency for them.


-Risk of Disassembly (Mousehunt) (100CP)
        When creating a trap with a hunter in mind, one must consider how often the hunter moves from region to region and also the wide variety of mice capable of utterly demolishing the trap. Since designing a trap to be unbreakable is likely to make it unwieldy, an alternative approach is to engineer it to fail. This philosophy applied to your crafting endeavours allows you to make things which are designed to safely break apart regardless of the circumstance sure, you'll have to reassemble it after it breaks, but the risk of it utterly disintegrating under the force of a dragon mouse's fire is removed.


-Ritualistic (Azeroth) (100CP)
        You are much more skilled at elaborate rituals. You often find that if a ritual calls for the blood of 10 virgins, you can get away with just 5. This only applies to magic such as Enchanting or Inscription, not to anything scientific in nature. So you'll still need those two batteries for your rock'em sock'em robots.


-Scavenger (Ravenwood) (100CP)
        Sometimes, you do not have the luxury of top of the line equipment and need to rely on what scraps you can salvage. You, however, have an advantage, being able to cobble together scavenged bits into functional equipment that work as well as the real deal. This talent will also inherently improve the durability of such improvised equipment to function even when such materials should not feasible hold up under the strains of use.


-Scrap Hound (Dead Space) (100CP)
        You build. Of course, you need parts to build, and, of course, you need materials, usually scrap metal or leftover electronic bits and bobs, to make parts. Whenever you go looking for scrap parts to use as materials, you always find more than you would otherwise, five instead of four, twenty-five instead of twenty, whatever. When you build parts from materials or scrap, you always find you need less materials, on the same order as that bonus, to put those parts together. Really, really useful if you plan to build electronically-based weapons, armor, etc, or extensively modify your own, pre-existing, equipment through similar means.


-Six Dollar Man (Sesame Street) (100CP)
Whenever you are trying to create some sort of machine, whether a robot or a car, pick a specific amount of money.  You can then find all of the necessary materials you need to make that item for exactly that specific amount of money.  You could even make a “six dollar man” robot for just under six dollars (including taxes).  Just keep in mind that if you lowball the standard cost for the desired invention too much, the perk will lead you into finding substandard items that, while technically functional, will cause the machine to malfunction.


-A Box of Scraps (Honkai Impact Third) (200CP)
        For rather straightforward inventions you can make them with just about anything if you have the knowledge of how the mechanics of it work. Simple substitutes are easy and you have the ability to fix things easily, able to patch things up with little more than chewing gum as a quick fix that will last a while.


-Advanced Materials (XCOM 2) (200CP)
        As you experiment the physics and rules of a world ideas for new materials come to you. Elements and compounds from different universes often follow the same rules after all, so it should be theoretically possible to mix them. While you are developing new materials for your projects you will instinctively know whether or not materials will be compatible with each other and roughly how strong they will be. You will not know the exact ratio or procedure you will need to perform to fabricate these exotic materials, and it's not guaranteed that every material will be compatible with each other, but development will be made a lot easier.


-Astromancy (A 'Happy' Harry Potter Fanfiction) (200CP)
        Maybe you were born under a rare cosmological sign, maybe the planets aligned upon your arrival, or maybe it's just luck but your connection to the stars and the movement of the spheres grants you a greater sense of time and the seasons. You know the exact date down to the millisecond if you just think about it, the perfect time to harvest ingredients or plant a garden, and the effect of the cosmos on the world. More than that the stars and their mysteries have an effect on you as well, your magic will be stronger at night some signs and planets affecting certain spells more than others, you'll have endless stamina during the full moon, and possess perfect night vision. You'll also be capable of finding and harvesting truly rare ingredients such as stardust, sunshards, moonbeams, shadow threads, etc. You'll also have a natural understanding of the prophetic significance of the passage of the celestial bodies in the sky, day or night. Those conversations with centaurs will finally make sense to you.


-Built-In Geo-Nav (Dead Space) (200CP)
        It's like you have a rare materials detector built into your head, with how easy you make it seem to find the really good stuff. Whenever you're looking for materials, be it rare metals, gemstones or crystals, or even just treasure in general, you can feel something, "pulling," your new quasi-sense in various directions, and in different ways based on what the material in question is. As a side benefit, this enhances your ability to navigate, allowing you to, in almost all cases, just kind of know the right direction to head in, to the point that your RIG will mark a path towards your hunch.


-Cold Fires (Final Fantasy XIV) (200CP)
        The hotter the fire, the easier the metal is to form -but too hot, and the metal will simply melt away. That's always been a conundrum which you had to solve. The mages however, have a different solution for your problem. By imbuing fire with Aether, you can reach the conditions necessary for forging at far lower temperatures than normal. Similarly, the intensity of any fire spell you cast is significantly increased.


-Delirium (Ravenwood) (200CP)
        Raw skill, talent, or ability, with a touch of madness. You possess the ability to collect Delirium, a raw form of drug-like ki formed from madness and chaos. The battlefield is rife with this chaotic energy. Using delirium, it is possible to push a skill to insane levels, and allow for surprising uses of your abilities.


-Duct Tape Master (CATastrophe) (200CP)
        Earless relics aren't the only thing that's shiny. You're a master at jerry-rigging mechanical components into an ungodly abomination of gears and circuits that somehow still works as intended. Fixing broken things is a breeze (though they might break more easily now) and making new teknologee by recycling parts from old ones is within the realm of your skills.


-Eccentric Talk (Medaka Box Abnormal) (200CP)
        It's so not cool to run out of bullets in the middle of a firefight. Dramatic? Sure, at the right time, but it is hella not fun to find yourself in that situation. Seems like you needn't worry from now on as any weapon you have just doesn't run out of ammunition. Whether it uses bullets or energy or something weird like rocks or rubbish, it looks like firing that stuff out doesn't actually get rid of it from within the weapon itself. Emptying the gun wouldn't let you take out as much ammo as you want, it only works when you're actually using it in the weapon.


-Essencetapping (Aion) (200CP)
        You know the basics of magically extracting valuable materials from your surroundings in a way that won't damage the environment or source. In addition; post-jump, you may use this ability to gather resources native to other settings. You have mastered extracting all but the most exotic materials, and as an added bonus; you often find rare materials in your endeavours. Also, your post-jump essencetapping will find the occasional Atreian material gathered alongside native ones.


-Garbage Bin Grants (World of Darkness - Genius the Transgression) (200CP)
        The sad truth is that artists starve and so do scientists. A certain number of resources will be eventually poured into a project and often enough the Genius in question finds themselves grasping for one last essential component but with little to no money left. You are unusually adept at finding useful components in the most unlikely places. As long as you have a garbage respiratory that can viably hold things that you need for a project, such as computer parts in a junkyard or car parts at an impound, you have a great likelihood of finding what you are looking for, and even finding things that you wouldn't expect on site that will help with future projects.


-Hunt Automation (Mousehunt) (200CP)
        If you're a hunter who relies exclusively on traps, the process of setting up a trap and waiting for a bite can get quite monotonous, even as you venture into unknown regions and get a chance to sightsee. Why not have the trap micromanage itself even more, so you don't have to sit and wait to reset the mechanism? For all of the traps at your disposal, you can arrange for them to automatically clean up and re-arm themselves, this only pulls a small bit of energy or stamina from you each time it activates, which can also serve as indication that your traps have triggered. Even in the event that your traps are destroyed, you can expend a greater portion of energy for them to reform themselves while you're doing something else provided that they aren't erased out of existence entirely anyways.


-Nuts And Bolts (Ben 10 0.1) (200CP)
        Okay, so you're tough and you can snatch a few wallets. But you know what a good start for making some money is? Salvage. You're excellent at finding useful parts and mundane materials on the fly. Need metal? Those old railroad spikes look handy. Need some wires? There's an intact bundle in that old machine over there. As it turns out, this also makes you pretty good at shoving these parts together to make something good...or at least something you can sell. Weirdo stuff like intact alien tech, special parts, or 'exotic' materials need a bit more work to get depending on how rare they are, but the effort's worth it, right?


-Professional Plunderer (God Catching Alchemy Meister) (200CP)
        Monsters are a curious thing, they destroy and threaten people on a daily basis, however, the drops and loot from hunting them can be highly profitable, especially from high-level ones in the hands of a skilled alchemist. Good artifacts need good materials and professional hands. In that sense, you got the first half in the bag already. You have insane luck when it comes to harvesting or looting raw materials, often encountering more than you wanted, of better quality and from time to time even drops far better than average.


-Reclaimer (Smash Up) (200CP)
        Not all parts are interchangeable, but the secret to fitting a square peg in a round hole is just to get a really good lathe to file the corners off with. You are the master of adapting parts to do wildly different jobs for systems they were never designed to interface with, even if you have to build the interface yourself.


-Reclaimer (Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Mechanicus) (200CP)
        Rare is the heretek with wealth or connections enough to acquire the resources to pursue innovation without raising suspicion. Most must make do with whatever they can scavenge or build for themselves, and fortune seems to often favor them when harvesting useful components from wrecked machines. More often than not, the most delicate and valuable pieces of technology can be pulled intact from wrecks you find or create.


-Universal Ammunition (Dead Space) (200CP)
        Plasma batteries? Javelin spears? Force energy? What are those? The only thing you ever seem to find, from here on out, as far as ammunition goes, aside from special ammo types, are these little gunmetal black and yellow battery-like ammo cartridges. The exchange rate varies from gun type to gun type, one clip, or magazine, or cartridge, or whatever, at a time, but it's always enough to fill the gun you're using. Just don't think about the logistics of having a single kind of ammunition that just works for every gun possible, pretend like it makes sense in the space future, and we'll all be just fine.


-Automatic Looting | Waste Not, Want Not (Mass Effect Andromeda) (300CP)
        Automatic Looting (100CP)
        A Technician can be called in to fix things in the middle of a fight. But when your focus is on keeping your head on your shoulders, who has time to pick up those supplies you ran past 3 hours ago? You, that's who! You now have two things: First, you have some sort of pocket-universe/bag-of-holding/bigger-on-the-inside backpack/whatever that allows you to carry a large amount of loot. The loot will be unsorted, and while you can carry a lot and not notice, you also cannot immediately use what's in your loot bag. You'll first have to have your mineral wealth in the right place to build something with it, and equipment needs to actually be equipped before it can be used. Second, you gain a sort of aura or field that will automatically put anything (that hasn't been claimed by another being) nearby you into your loot bag. Stumble across a dead Kett, you get all the loot a thorough check would have found you if you'd taken your time. A farmer's vegetable field wouldn't work, unless you are knowingly stealing from the owner. The size of the looting-aura grows with how quickly you can move and what areas you can actually access. And the loot you get is determined by your skills. For example, if you have butchery skills, you can auto-loot meat, bones, and/or skin, while skills with electronics would let you get intact pieces of robots. The size of a single item would go up to and include a shuttle or the Nomad. If you run into something bigger than that, you'd need to have the skills to break it down to fit it.
        Waste Not, Want Not (200CP)
        Sometimes a Technician just doesn't have the resources they need to get the job done. That's when you have to get creative with what you consider a resource. You have the ability to break down objects that you can personally move into their component parts and/or resources, whichever you wish. If you need a bit of Eezo, an Initiative gun should have some. Don't want to murder some harmless Eirochs? Kett gear usually has some Eiroch Fluid Sacs incorporated into it. In addition to breaking down objects, you also have an accompanying pocket dimension for just resources and/or component parts. It doesn't weigh on you, and you can easily carry around enough resources for any job. If you have the Automatic Looting perk, you can choose to have any raw resources you pick up to go straight into your Resources Bag. And any crafting you do can pull straight from your Resources Bag.


-Makeshift Weaponry (Bartimaeus Sequence) (300CP)
        Did you just duct tape that magic wand together? Never mind, apparently you CAN do that. Using exceedingly mundane tools, you are able to repair and make improvements to weapons that by all rights shouldn't be able to be repaired that way. Why yes, you CAN glue the detonation stick back together and make it work just fine. Oh and don't worry about that shattered elemental sphere, we can just tie it back together with twine!


-More With Less (XCOM) (300CP)
        Through careful construction, you can remove unnecessary components and get maximum efficiency into your products. What this means, is that you can create the same quality item while using less resources. Items with which you have a limited supply, such as alien materials, can be stretched farther.


-No Monsters Were Harmed in the Making of This Product (Monster Girl Encyclopedia) (300CP)
        The bodies of monsters are useful resources for all sorts of things (Dragon scales make nifty armor, Slime substances can be used for various potions/elixirs, Demon Realm Boar meat is incredibly healthy and invigorating, etc.), so now that monsters are friendly (sometimes too friendly), it's become easier to obtain these once-rare ingredients. However, this leads to a dilemma: how to extract the items without hurting the innocent Mamono. At the lowest level, this perk helps you sense what parts of a creature's body could be useful/profitable (it won't help you exactly identify their use, but it will at least let you know if they're worth taking a look at). But more than that, the perk enables you to easily extract things from a subject's body without actually harming the individual, even if doing so would normally hurt or even kill the person. The subject will generally heal any scars without trouble afterwards, and any removed parts that are irreplaceable will regenerate. Plus, you gain increased skill at preserving the extracted materials for extended durations until you can find a good use for them or hawk them off to buyers.


-Scrapper (Fallout 4) (300CP)
        You have the capability to dismantle and repurpose objects for your own creations; even ones that you might not fully understand. So long as it's not hopelessly beyond your understanding, indestructible, or ridiculously big, you're capable of taking most things and reducing them to their base components, salvaging any working parts with only a few days of work at the worst.


-Scrapyard Skills (Swat Kats) (300CP)
        Where others see junk, you see treasure just waiting to be utilized. You can make far more use out of scrap metal and tossed out electronics, repurposing them for many different tasks. That washer machine might have the parts needed to help spin an engine turbine, or that piston tube might be JUST the right size to refashion into a grappling hook launcher... it's all in how you use it and how you repurpose things.


-Waste Not (Monster Hunter) (300CP)
         You have found out a great secret in the blacksmithing trade – the reason that most blacksmiths usually ask for so many materials to make a certain weapon or armor isn’t because its material intensive, but because they can make one for half of the materials and either sell the rest or make another to sell at a profit. The bastards! You have figured out how to use less materials to gain the same result when it comes to crafting your own weapon and armor. At first, it may just be an ore or two less, but with enough practice, you can reduce the amount of materials needed for a project by half[rounded down]. As an added bonus, with enough practice, you have a fifty percent chance to not require high grade or legendary materials [Rubies, Plates, etc] to make an item, provided you can supplement the build with excess materials.


-Arcane Emulation (D&D Eberron) (400CP)
        To enchant is to create the greatest of items. To enchant without magic is pure bullshit, but is doable with certain tricks shared only amongst the most secretive of crafters. Thanks either to learning from them or to discovering these abilities yourself, you can craft magical items without the need for related spellcasting. Further, you know all the little tricks to minimise the resource costs of your items, which whilst minimal by themselves add up to maybe halving the total time and resource expenditure per item.


-Efficiency (Ninjango - Masters of Spinjitzu) (400CP)
        Waste not, want not! Not with this, anyway whether building machines or making quick moves in combat, you'll never unintentionally use more energy, materials, or flourish than you need to.


-Heart of Fire | Quick Seed (Nexus 2.0) (400CP)
Heart of Fire (200CP)
        Fire Elementals possess a form of magic called the Ember. This magic grants incredible resistance, bordering on immunity, to heat and flames, though it does nothing for the pain that heat can cause. However, that is merely a side effect. The true use of Ember is as a form of refinement, materials exposed to ember infused flame have their traits enhanced. Food becomes tastier and more nutritious, metals become more resilient, and potions last longer or have an increased effect. This does, however, require the material to be exposed to flame, so this will not work on certain materials.
Quick Seed (200CP)
        Seeds are normally slow to grow, with more Light potentially cracking it open and wasting the effort. Sapphire goblins, however, have taken what many would consider a hazard and turned it into an art. Any Seed formed by a sapphire goblin is more stable, able to be pushed farther before it breaks open, allowing them to build them up faster. Additionally, in moments of need, a sapphire goblin can overload a Seed, holding it together just long enough to overpower it, before they let it break to use the Seed at a much higher power than normal.


-High-Tech, Meet Low-Tech (Revelation Space) (400CP)
        Beyond the Yellowstone system, technology is often not quite up to speed. More so, in the Post-Melding time. Colonists isolated by lightyears from their nearest neighbors must be ready to handle any failure of their machines, so reliable, low technology is usually more common than quickmatter and full automation. Yet when it comes to merging the two, you have a fascinating ability to keep high-technology devices running by replacing failing systems with low-tech equivalents. Where a space station might have used superconductor radiator panels to manage temperature, you could find a way to replace them with steam cooling; when your shuttles run out of antimatter, you'll find it easy to replace those drives with a fusion torch or even chemical rockets. At the extreme limits of your ability, you might replace a simple but essential computer with a mechanical calculator, crunching out numbers with cogs, punch cards and levers.


-Honor the Machine Spirit (Warhammer 40k - Adeptus Astartes) (400CP)
        Apothecaries tend to the bodies of the dead, Chaplains to their spirits. Techmarines tend to the spirits of the Machine. You are a skilled salvager. For example, while others might see a destroyed tank, you can see a way to salvage usable parts, perhaps restoring another vehicle to fighting trim or finding a way to save unique weapon systems to be re-used another day. This also gives you a strong grounding in the Rites of Reverse Engineering, able to examine unknown technology and figure out basic functionality by comparing it to devices you are already familiar with. You also have a much broader definition of the word 'damaged', able to restore machinery that others would swear was inoperable or destroyed given enough time and as long as you have enough of the original damaged parts to work with.


-Lack of Materials (God of War) (400CP)
        Times are tough in this land. Forces beyond knowing, monsters that roam the lands, and gods who are as petty as they are powerful. With chaos such as this, there are times you may not be able to get everything that you need. But you've learned to make do. You can get the most out of your materials, using two bars of metal where you might need four, or three hides when you need six. Of course, if you DO have all the materials required you can use them to make your creations more effective in quality and capability as well. So maybe it doesn't hurt to put the extra mile in.


-Making Do With Less (Freefall) (400CP)
        Is your last name Ambrose or perhaps MacGyver? Any time you use materials, they always seem to just work better than they should. Utterly useless scraps become usable if makeshift repairs and construction. Decent stuff is spun into great, great to esoteric, esoteric to outright absurd results. If used on the same thing twice, it won't enhance previously affected pieces further, though newly added bits would be. So long as you already had the skills, you could get a ship space worthy using only the random stuff that a none too knowledgeable thief happened to scrounge together. If you already had a perk that improved the effective quality/usefulness of materials, this would be added on top of that.


-Mauler (Command and Conquer: Tiberium Wars) (400CP)
        You have the skills of a junkyard hound, able to make even the most heavily damaged tech work again. Even machines too battle-damaged for recovery 20 years ago can be effective under your wrench. Repurposing tech and equipment is your forte; you can turn a pneumatic screwdriver into a reasonable cannon, and heaven help your enemies if you get anywhere near mining equipment, as a power-armored mutant is quickly appearing in their future. There was even one time where you made a toaster into a reasonable facsimile of a flamethrower.....


-Monster Harvesting (Warhammer Fantasy - Amazons) (400CP)
        Without the power of industry or technology that civilisations like the empire have access to, the Amazons have learnt to be resourceful in other ways. They and now you have become masters of taking the bodies of fallen foes and turning them into weapons, tools and armour. Not only are these removed parts of enemies just as effective as when the enemy was alive, they even retain any special powers or magical qualities they had at the time, even if the being would normally need to be alive to supply those powers. Poisonous fangs will continue to bleed venom even after being torn from a giant snake's mouth and turned into a sword, whilst a monster that naturally produced magical wards would continue to do so even when it's hide had been stripped and turned to armour. Along with this skill for harvesting comes notable talent for creating weapons, armour and tools.


-Resource Efficiency (Mass Effect Andromeda) (400CP)
        It's nice being efficient. It lets you make more with less, stretching out vital supplies even further. With this perk, any time you are crafting something, you can make it for half the materials. Just don't ask how you got a full cake from half the amount of ingredients. In addition, anytime you break down an item, you get the full amount of resources that went into it. So, breaking down a gun you made for 50% resources would give you those 50% resources, compared to a gun made by someone else who used the full amount in the construction, and thus giving you the total amount.


-Scavenge (Hellgate London) (400CP)
        You can find usable food and materials anywhere you look, even if you search a empty gas station you are bound to find at least a couple boxes of whatever ammunition you use and some food. When used on equipment or electronics you always find whatever parts would be useful to you.


-Ship's Engineer (Smash Up) (400CP)
        It takes a lot of know-how to keep a spaceship running, especially with all the things they get put through. Not only are you an expert in the technology of the future, you've learned how to be incredibly resourceful in improvising technology. From using lasers to heat rocks or forge metals, to building a laser with the contents of a prison cell, if an Engineer doesn't have the tools they need, well they'll make the tools themselves!


-Shipping the Product (F.E.A.R.) (400CP)
        Prototypes are one thing, but what about actually getting the damn thing distributed? An item or weapon doesn't help anyone if it's the only one of its kind. You will find your ability to create has increased dramatically in efficiency, letting you use the materials for three of the same items to actually make five while streamlining production lines rather quickly. As a bonus, logistics have increased enough where your shipped supplies are harder to intercept, keeping any allies you have fresh with resources!


-Ultra-High Settings (Generic Video Game Developer) (400CP)
        While many may wish they had the beastly computers needed to run games on max settings, many don't. But why should we limit the beauty of your art for such a mundane reason? Your art and animations are such that no matter how hi-res the models or complex the animation it will have a minimal, if any, impact on how well your game runs. This also applies to other items and products you help create, meaning even the shittiest of computers or consoles can run your game at the highest resolution without suffering too much, while products like swords can have designs might seem to hinder a user's ability to swing it when in fact it's just as usable as a normal one.


-Unfed Forge (Desolate Era Part II - The Chaosverse) (400CP)
        The biggest problem with techniques or artifacts is that eventually, if you don't rise in power, status, or connections, you won't be able to procure the necessary materials needed to also bring your power up to par with others at your level. So I'd say it's a good thing that you have the ability to use the same materials at lower levels to create things at your level of power. If you felt like it you could use Steel to make a Golem capable of killing Celestial Immortals while you were a World God. With materials meant for actual immortals, even baseline Celestial Immortals, you would be able to create artifacts capable of comparing to Universe treasures while weaker than Hegemons assuming you have such a mastery of forging.


-Extraction Efficiency | Harmless Extraction | Rapid Growth (Final Fantasy XIV) (500CP)
        Extraction Efficiency (100CP)
        Judging from the state of Eorzea, the Carpenters and other tradesmen here have long since improved the efficiency of their resource collecting processes. From the record books, while the presence of Aether has helped a great deal, the harvesting practices put into place played a large part as to why the natural landscape is still the way it is today. Adopting those same practices, you've improved on the harvesting efficiency for all manners of things, not just restricted to trees -but other plant life as well. So at least the plant doesn't simply die off after one round.
        Harmless Extraction (200CP)
        With hempen yarn and animal skins in shorter supply since the catastrophe, you and other craftsmen have had to adapt your practices in order to keep the orders met. Practices to minimize the amount of animals killed, to make the most out of that which you have on hand are all crucial nowadays as resources grow scarcer. While the animals still aren't too comfortable with it, with this magic you can weave together a copy of their skin or wool, while only taking a small portion of what they have. It doesn't really feel right, but at least the animal is still alive! It'll take time, but what you've taken will slowly grow back.
        Rapid Growth (200CP)
        You can't afford to wait years for a forest to regrow! By the time that forest grows to a state where it's ready for harvest, you won't even need the lumber to build your house anymore! No, in order to make it in time for harvest this season, you're going to need to draw on some more potent forces.It might be a little bit dangerous to use Aether in such a fashion, but by imbuing the saplings with concentrated Aether, you've successfully sped up the growth rate of the trees -to a point where you can harvest them again. Well, unfortunately, the trees did grow a bit bigger than normal, but you expect that's just a normal side effect from using concentrated Aether to grow things.


-2x4 tech genius (Kids Next Door) (600CP)
        You're able to put together incredible creations from simple household objects. A piece of wood, a battery, a glass bottle, and some duct tape, you can turn it into a working laser rifle. Everything that you make will be very fragile, and more complex creations will require more complex components.


-Lost Art (Generic Video Game Developer) (600CP)
        You are now an expert of the lost art, the art of code efficiency. Any code and software you make will now be far more efficient, using up far less resources for the same results and running significantly faster than most standard code. Your game would normally be 16GB and requires 8GB of RAM? Now it uses half that, at least. Game causing lag and crashing because too much is going on? Not anymore. Whatever you code, it'll run fast, and it'll run well.


-Mana Substitution (Generic Builder) (600CP)
        Lacking materials needed for your building? Use magic to permanently create them from nothing if you have blueprints for them (rare, powerful or combined materials take more magic).


-Practical Applications (Family Matters) (600CP)
        You have a gift, not for a specific skill, but for applying your skills. Even in bad conditions, with limited resources, you can still get the job done. Whether it is turning ketchup and water into spaghetti sauce, or building technological marvels in your basement from a pile of odd parts, you can make things work, even in circumstances that are considerably less than optimal. You are also extremely innovative and creative with your skills, easily finding inspiration and motivation for your projects.


-REPAIR, REUSE, RECYCLE (PREY) (600CP)
        Neuromods aren't the only revolutionary technology developed on Talos I. The ability to break down components to their constituent materials and dividing them into 4 categories of materials which can be used by a fabricator to make almost anything. These are divided into Synthetic, Mineral, Organic and Exotic. You know all the ins and outs of this technology, able to make it more precise in dividing up material up to the elemental level or divide new materials at the cost of a little more energy. Scaled up you could use these devices to quickly refine mined material strip mined from a planet and use them to mass produce buildings and vehicles. The energy required to make the item is directly proportional to their complexity and size.


-Scavenger (Generic Space Opera) (600CP)
        You have an excellent intuition when it comes to finding and salvaging still functional technology. You can see at a glance if a device is still functional and have a general intuition on how to use it and what the effects would be. You also have the uncanny ability to pick out still functional components of unknown tech and can kludge together temporary fixes of technology vastly beyond your understanding, though those will break down and make said technology unrecoverable after a while.


-The Way of the Cube (Unmodded Minecraft) (600CP)
        Whether you were born to the cube or merely adopted it, you have internalized some of the principles of this world and made them your own. When you harvest something, you can choose to have it fall apart into whatever shapes and portions you desire. Pluck a plant from your garden or slaughter an animal from your stables, and they will be instantly and perfectly divided up among edible portions, usable materials and all other categories without the slightest waste. Things harvested with this perk are also just better, blemishes, damage and imperfections corrected during the process. This perk can't be used as a form of attack, so no punching the bones out of someone that bothers you.


-You Built it Out of What? (DC - Blackest Night) (600CP)
        Would you believe the Cosmic Divining Rod, the source of this oncoming disaster, was built out of a mishmash of parts found in a hardware store in some corner on Earth? Whether from your own mastery of engineering or similar mad inspiration, you have a knack for constructing advanced devices out of nothing but common Earth parts and other easy-to-obtain materials. Spaceships made of salvaged parts? Sure. A rod capable of contacting a particular Entity and manipulating emotions? Why not? You can also apply this to other science or engineering you're capable of, substituting rare materials with common parts, and working with as much durability and effectiveness as the real thing.


-Research and Deploy (Terraria - Journey's End) (800CP)
        The secrets of research and duplication are now at your fingertips, though there are a few changes compared to the version from the game. The basic process is still the same. You can 'destructively research' a given item in your inventory or that you can and are holding entirely in your hands, and once you have researched enough of them, you will be able to instantly duplicate said item. However, you aren't able to simply duplicate it for free. Instead, you can sacrifice additional items to build up a reservoir of 'material' that can then be used to create duplicates. Rarer items provide more material, with the amount needed to research a given item being a general baseline. So, if it took 100 items to research one item, and only 1 item to research another, then you would have to sacrifice 100 more of the first item to make one duplicate of the second. A second change is that the number of items that must be researched has been increased. Items that normally might have only taken 1 item to research now need 3 or more, and an item that might have normally taken 10 could take 40 or 50. CP-Backed items can be researched, but their duplicates won't have their CP-backed powers, only the default powers of whatever type of item they are. You can substitute raw mana for 'material', allowing you to create items without having to sacrifice other items first, as long as you have a sufficient amount of mana.
-Reusable Resources | Artificial Alloys (Anno 2070) (800CP)
        Reusable Resources (200CP)
        Recycling requires effort. There is always a loss - in terms of energy, in terms of time, in terms of effort, in terms of materials. Your faction's knowledge of materials science has minimized this loss to the utmost; When destroying buildings, recovering crashed vehicles, or decommissioning equipment, you always recover the same amount of material put into its construction, ripe for being re-applied to other tasks.
        Artificial Alloys (600CP)
        Naturally occurring substances can offer a good start point for the development of new and innovative machinery and technology. However, oftentimes these natural resources have limitations - whether it be rarity, difficulty of acquisition, and so on. In such cases, science steps to the fore, fashioning new materials unseen by nature to do that which mother nature started. This ability allows, with enough time and research invested, to create substances that mimic those found in nature, albeit manufactured artificially. While these new artificial substances do not surpass the original, it can for all purposes be substituted by it with no drawbacks. However, the material must still be manufactured - but, once the process is known, other factions, civilizations, and individuals, by following the process, can also create the artificial material. This ability works post-jump, even for materials that do not naturally occur in the new universe.


-Panzerkampf | Firestorm (Sabaton) (900CP)
        Panzerkampf (300CP)
        When it comes to building war machines, yours are top-notch! A gun made by your own hand will never jam, and a tank built by you will never bog down in mud or take damage from an IED. If they want to destroy what you've built, they'd best bring their A-game.
        Firestorm (600CP)
        When someone absolutely, positively needs artillery good enough to reduce the greatest castle to rubble, they come to you and accept no substitutes. You can throw a cannon together from scraps and it will still outperform the best mortars of the age. Moreover, in other worlds, if you can understand the weapon, you can produce something 1.1 times as strong with the items you would find in a rubbish heap, provided they're of equal size to the device they're replicating.




 --- Domain: Quality: Safety (37) (22 Perks) --- 




-Cry Havoc (World of Darkness - Genius The Transgression) (100CP)
        Mortals cause wondrous technology to go haywire, endangering lives and property. Geniuses call this unique ability of mortals to ruin their creations "Havoc." A wonder touched, picked up, or interacted with by a mere mortal (a being with no supernatural powers) roils with uncertainty and prolonged contact can break down even the most powerful Wonders. In addition this worsens as a mere mortal interacts with the Wonder, for to them the device makes no sense and pointing out the patches that Mania maintains is a good way to unweave them. You can now apply this inscrutability and inability to use technology beyond the kin of mere mortals to all of your technology at will, even when not in contact with the technology or if you only recently gained this power but crafted the device earlier in your carrier. This only applies if the technology would usually be inscrutable to the person in question, those who can understand the tech won't count for Havoc called in this way.


-Divine Rights Management (Unsong) (100CP)
        Why would you ever teach a man to fish, when you could make him come begging to you for every dinner?
        You have a powerful ability to build fine-tuned break-down and failure conditions into just about anything you create, weaving them inextricably into your designs; your creations can be hobbled so irrevocably that they cannot be made whole without also negating the principles that make them function. Only a genius far greater from your own could free what you have limited.


-Guarding the Ark (Lords of the Night - Vampire) (100CP)
        A common important duty for many angels is guarding holy sites and items, for such things can be dangerous to the faithful, and targets of the iniquitous. Perhaps you held such duties in the past? How can you know? This trick hints at such a history. You have freed a splinter of your true essence from your incarnate form and may invest it in an object you currently control - you don't need to be the owner, but it can't currently be contested - you could use it on a stolen sword, but not one someone is trying to wrestle out of your hands. Once invested, it will stay so unless the object is exorcised, or you call back your splinter.
        While invested, you count as possessing the object, and as acting as a Watcher, being able to see and sense what goes on around it. You may also start acting as an Controller, Corrupter, and Enhancer when and as you wish. Basically, you can sense what goes on around your object, you may animate moving parts (make a crossbow load itself, make a wagon roll), may curse those who use your object in a way you don't want, and may make it act like a magical item whose strength depends on your strength. These roles are laid out in The Book of Vile Darkness. This perk may be bought more then once. Each time it's bought, you rip free another splinter to invest. Only the first purchase is free from The Lost, but they may buy more at discount.


-Hands Off! (Starcraft II - Nova Covert Ops) (100CP)
        When one is at the forefront of technological development, one sometimes has to watch out for espionage. Why bother developing a revolutionary new weapon system when a Ghost with sticky fingers walks in and takes it? You are able to design, and seamlessly implement security protocols into any technology or equipment you have access to that would limit use to only authorized personnel. You don't even have to go to the extreme of half-breaking it either, that's for neanderthals and inferior scientists.


-My Creations, My Children (Heaven's Lost Property) (100CP)
        The Angelroids and other constructs you make are not mere drones or robots - they are, each and every one, your own child. Whether or not you consider that true or care for them at all, your creations with any degree of intelligence or sentience will look to you as a mentor or parental figure, or just a dear friend when you first activate them. Regardless of its nature, they will enter this world with a degree of loyalty towards you, their creator. You know how to maintain this through care or the right mix of discipline and caretaking. This, incidentally, makes you pretty good at actual parenting as well.


-Black Boxing (Warhammer 40k - Squats) (200CP)
        While certain red-robed rats of Mars always trying to get their grubby mechadendrites on your stuff is annoying, messing with them is endlessly entertaining. You can easily tweak your work to be nearly impossible for others to duplicate. If you're feeling particularly spiteful, you can build in some cross-connections so anyone trying will blow themselves up.


-Father (Blade Runner 2049) (200CP)
        Your children are very precious but not irreplaceable. It's something they remember well when they look at you and see a God. Anything you have created, from natural means or artificially, sees you as a God if you wish it. It can be as a terrifying, wrathful and strict God or as a benevolent, loving and protective God if you desire but they will find your superiority and position to be undeniable. This is not an unbreakable belief but it is strongly held, with enough proof to the otherwise your creations may be convinced that you are not as deserving of such terrified obedience or worshipful devotion. But proving that you are worthy shouldn't be too hard.


-Fumble Spotter (Generic Cubicle) (200CP)
        You excel at finding odd ways in which your products might be used or misused that could lead them to fail, and in devising ways to fix them before they ever become issues. You are also adept at making the proper usage for your products obvious in their design.


-Jumper Technology Activation (Stargate Atlantis) (200CP)
        This isn't so much an item as an upgrade for any item that you've bought with CP or personally made; its user interface will now only work for you and those (if any) you specify. You can change the lock on an affected device just by giving it new orders, but for any given individual this access is all or nothing. The upgrade will also prevent the interface from being bypassed unless it is physically removed, replaced or destroyed.
        * 200CP is for a la carte


-Precision Tools (MtG - New Phyrexia) (200CP)
        The exarchs, elite of the Core Augurs creations, managed to create a thought field specifically attuned to the Mirran resistances minds, disabling their will. While you might not be as versed in the neuroscience involved(yet), you have found a way to attune your creations to a certain group of targets' ' ensuring they will not damage your own allies. This also lets you make your own creations useless against you, ensuring they wont be used to fight you not for long, anyways.


-Fantasian (Sorcerer's Apprentice) (300CP)
        Unlike a certain mouse, you maintain impeccable control over any animated objects you create. While it's not like they're truly incapable of overdoing tasks you set, they'll definitely check in with you before doing anything drastic. Constructs with animal intelligence will also quickly and correctly interpret any hand signals you attempt to send, no matter how clumsy. This has some reverse application to non magical applications, like machinery.


-Qu-it It (Irredeemable/Incorruptible) (300CP)
        Your understanding of the technology that you have created or understood to the point where you can consider it 'yours' is so great that you find it almost trivial to come up with methods to use that understanding to deny the benefits of that technology to others who have either appropriated it or developed in parallel. Your understanding of your own created teleportation technology may be so great you can destroy an entire galaxy spanning network of teleporters based on your tech all with the push of a button. However you cannot do this for technology in the hands of those who were the source of the technology, no matter how well you understand it or feel possessive of it, not by the means of this perk at any rate.


-Shaping Gloves (Geneforge) (300CP)
        This pair of carefully crafted gloves allows one to work with powerful or specially modified essence without the typical risks of horrible mutilation, mutation, and death. Usually such gloves are crafted for a specific purpose, these aren't, they seem to work with anything, even Geneforges.


-Deep-Layer Protocols (Crysis) (400CP)
        Technology in your possession is unique in the manner that it is incapable of deviation from your stated goals. Normally, nanomachines detached from the collective whole would run the risk of having their original goals corrupted or subverted without the greater collective to issue orders, but technology held by you can be proofed so such errors are self-correcting. The only way to remove your tech from play is to destroy or disable it. Hacking or other 'tricks' short of a full rewrite by someone who knows what they're doing will not work.


-Fetishist (World of Darkness - Werewolf the Apocalypse) (400CP)
        When using Gifts or other kinds of magic to Bind a spirit or creature either in place or into a receptacle, it is far harder for the target to resist. Once bound, it is impossible for them to escape without outside help.


-Laz'r'us Nannies (Schlock Mercenary Rebuild) (400CP)
        A set of nanites that, when implanted in an individual, will slow their aging to effectively nothing and back up their mind within their skin and other organs, and which can work to regenerate them and revive them, allowing an individual to revive from anything outside of majority body disintegration. And if the nanites are linked to a strong enough computer system, they can upload a copy of the user's mind periodically, which can then be loaded into a cloned body. Comes with a device for creating more, and implanted nannies will adapt to new biologies automatically.


-Secrecy is the Key to Diabolical Success (Donkey Kong Country) (400CP)
        It is critical that top-secret projects remain top secret, even from the people working on it. You are able to ensure that everyone carrying out a secret plan or project you have devised remain completely ignorant of what they are doing/making, without hindering their ability to carry out the plan. For instance, you could have each individual soldier make a single part in his spare time and have your general assemble them together in pitch darkness without peeking, and the secret superweapon will be constructed just as according to plan. That said, it won't work if you need to tell people what the plan is, and sometimes it's a good idea to let your allies know what's up before they reach (wrong) conclusions of their own.


-That's Just Asking For Trouble (Ben 10 0.1) (400CP)
        When you make advanced technology far beyond what the locals are used to, it tends to make waves. Maybe your little DNA database is actually one of the greatest weapons ever created or an attempt to prove you can harness the fundamental forces of the universe ends up destroying a planet. The good news is you're not stupid it's the Genius tree, not the Drooling Idiot tree! You have excellent insight into the moral implications and long-term effects of your inventions if they were used by others or made commonly available, especially when it would be a purely bad idea. Also, just to make sure nobody steals or misuses it, any sort of failsafe you make to keep it from being abused is unable to be hacked or bypassed...if you made a device that works only for a certain person, no amount of hacking or DNA swapping will make someone else pass off as that person. If you need two keys to unlock a certain feature, you bet only those two keys will work. This goes both ways all your devices will come with a backdoor for you to take back control if someone does misuse it, and it will always succeed. Enjoy the look on the face of a wannabe thief when the superweapon they stole from you just shuts down in their hand.


-Smart Immunity (Limitless) (500CP)
        You've had one hit of NZT in the past week, and it seems like you'll never come down. Well, you actually won't, not if you don't want to, that is. You may choose for up to 10 drugs, magical spells, buffs, or similar time-limited boosts that are affecting you to last indefinitely without any of their unwanted side effects. Additionally, you may choose to end any effect (not just the ones maintained by this perk) whenever you want, either through conscious choice or automatically (it is called Smart Immunity for a reason) if you somehow can't but would have if you could. If you already have 10 effects being maintained by this and want to add another, you'll have to allow one of the ones you're maintaining to lapse. You may also extend the duration of any temporary effect by a factor of ten, based on its full duration when applied, but these effects keep their side effects. When you drop an effect from its slot it will continue with any of its original duration it has left. Additionally you may reapply any effect that you have lost if the time since you lost it isn't greater than twice (after adding the potential 10* extension) the duration it offers. Capstone Booster


-A Creator's Love (Warhammer Fantasy - Tomb Kings) (600CP)
        They underestimate the love you put into what you create. The pride of a Necrotect, a true Necrotect, is not just in his own skill but also in the wellbeing of his own creations. For you to awaken and see that the tomb that you built and were buried in still stands, unbroken despite the many centuries of abuse it has suffered, how could you possibly not feel the love of a parent for how long your creations stood tall. For some Necrotects, their creations begin to respond in kind, moving to their will to serve their creator-parents. You may command and control any such construct you have designed and crafted or overseen the construction of as the head of the team. The stone of your tomb bows to your will, blocks shuffling and rolling about to create new configurations. Swords that you craft sharpen or lose their edge at your command or even turn upon their wielders. In your presence, your constructions will even repair themselves from damage, healing as if they were truly alive.


-Corruption of Good! (Dungeon Keeper Ami) (600CP)
        Who says corruption has to be a bad thing? If used in the correct way even the powers of darkness can be powerful weapons in the arsenal of the light. Through prayer and ritual you can turn even the darkest of artifacts to the side of good, channeling the lights power instead of the accursed darkness, as an outgrowth of this you can also "corrupt" or otherwise turn beings of evil into being good and following the path of the light given time and effort even the darkest of creatures can be made to see the light.


-Three Laws of Robotics (SB Dragonball Z) (600CP)
        Isn't it annoying when those teenagers you kidnapped and subjected to brutal experiments against their will decide to kill you when free? Well no more, because everything you create, birth, or modify is simply incapable of betraying or harming you. While this only applies to creations which can think, you'll never have to worry about them working against your orders, in both wording and spirit. You may choose whether or not this applies to whatever creation you make.




 --- Domain: Quality: Size (38) (24 Perks) --- 




-Engineered to Scale (Mousehunt) (200CP)
        To date, the largest mouse that's been observed weighs in at a staggering 2400 lbs. To contrast this, in the same environment exists a mouse that barely weighs an ounce. Clearly a trap that works on the former would be ridiculously inefficient for the latter, but hunters will typically demand a single trap type, so they don't have to get used to different traps operating with different mechanics. You can address this problem during the production cycle by manipulating the size of your creation: making it twice as large or half as large, whichever is most appropriate.
        Creations made this way do not require extra resources or additional tuning to function, and they'll function just as well with the size taken into consideration.


-Loaded Up (Generic Cyberpunk) (200CP)
        It's not enough to have what you need locked away back in the workshop, and even when you have time to prepare you often have to pack light. You have a particular genius when it comes to building and working with tools, gadgets, weapons, armor, and other personal scale equipment. Whether it's cramming a computing setup that would take up an entire workstation into something that a hacker can slap onto their arm for on the fly hacking, or taking a normal pistol and modding it until it's more lethal and effective than most military arms, you're able to cram a stupefying amount of effectiveness into easily ported packages. Your creativity, skills, and genius just seem to skyrocket when dealing with things in sizes that would hamper anybody else. Bigger doesn't always mean better, sometimes it just means cumbersome.


-Nanotech Wizard (Ratchet & Clank) (200CP)
        You acquire a basic understanding of the nanotech of this universe. Use it to fix yourself up when you get hurt, or use it on others. If integrated with weapons or armor, it gives them the capacity to upgrade over time and to potentially change their abilities.


-They Will Prosper (Marvel Magic) (200CP)
        Being able to make fantastical tech that can compete even with magic is all well and good, but is it really being put to optimal use if you're the only one directly benefiting from using it? You will find you have a knack for scaling personal technology to a larger size. Turn a personal shield into something that can protect an entire city or make your particle gun into a weapon of mass destruction. Of course, just because you can figure out the logistics behind increasing the scale of your technology doesn't mean you actually have the resources to make these plans into a reality -- and you can bet increasing the scale by a large degree will see a comparative increase in the cost of resources.


-Weapons Recombination Template (Final Fantasy XIII-2) (200CP)
        The shady dealer (Actually it seems like everything he's offered so far is shady) just shrugs when you pick this up. Apparently, it binds two weapons together, and allows you to shapeshift the weapon between either form. You're not quite sure how it works, but he demonstrates it to you by showing you how a bow can shift into a sword. You can't help but notice that it also turned into a Moogle afterwards...but apparently yours won't do that. Unless you throw a Moogle into the mix. Wait...does that mean...


-Factorissimo (Satisfactory-Factorio Gauntlet) (300CP)
        You can make buildings that are bigger on the inside. The larger the building, the greater the ratio of inside-space to outside-space. A small warehouse could be the size of a large warehouse internally (~5x isotropic linear scaling,) while an arcology the size of an island would be the size of the entire island chain inside (~1000x isotropic linear scaling.) The main problem with these is that they have limited slots for belts or pipes to go in or out. The expansion may be non-isotropic; that is it may be scaled by more in one direction than another.
        You may also do the reverse and create a building that is smaller inside than outside, or smaller in one direction and larger in another.
        The interior and exterior sizes of these buildings are set during the design process, and are fixed for all buildings of the same type. In addition, you can place these buildings inside each other, creating recursive expanded spaces.
        You can pick one up with your Builder without breaking them. If you do this, any machinery inside is frozen in time, and any living being is ejected from space where the entrance was.


-Gadget Master (007) (300CP)
        You've been trained by Major Boothroyd at the skills of his job. You're excellent at creating and maintaining gadgets of all types. You can miniaturize nearly anything, and hide things in forms that... really shouldn't work. You can even make lasers! You're also good at coming up with ideas for unusual methods of assassination; beheading umbrellas, flamethrower bagpipes, and the like.


-Tinkerer (RWBY) (300CP)
        You're a whiz at maintaining, modifying and making things. Everything from Sniper Scythes to Toaster Ovens, as long as you made it yourself or had the blueprints on hand. Unlock the secret of Variable Weapon Crafting.


-A Matter of Scale (Warhammer 40k - Squats) (400CP)
        Let others joke about compensating, you know the engineering it takes to make war-machines function. Most devices work best in a narrow range of sizes, too big and they become unwieldy, too small and insufficiently powerful for the job. Either way efficiency drops off sharpy. Not for you. You can scale up weapons to level cities and slay Titans, or miniaturize them almost to the point of digi-weapons with no loss of functionality, and can do this for virtually any technology.


-Data Compression (Hive Queen Quest) (400CP)
        As an artificial intelligence being able to move, alter, and compress data is something more than a hobby for you, it is a way of life. As such you are so good at compressing data without harming its function that you could fit an entire artificial intelligence onto a pocket calculator if you had too and it would still work! Copying an entire database to fit onto a usb stick? SIMPLE. Be careful however the internal memory basically works as the life span of an AI, when it runs out the AI dies. Besides you never know when someone may catch on to your little tricks...


-Dimensional Addition or Subtraction (Generic Builder) (400CP)
        While any Builder's claimed space may be stretched or limited according to the Builder's ability and preferences, you have an exceptional knack for expanding or shrinking the space inside of your claimed areas, chests that have several rooms inside of them, police boxes that are the size of a large house, a forest that has trails that are merely a block or two when they should be far longer or even turning that child's backyard into an entire magical forest with enough skill.


-Hybridization Theory (Zoids Legacy) (400CP)
        So one day you had a bit of spare time after your daily Zoid admiration hour. After taking a close look at your favorite Gojulas and your favorite Mad Thunder, you decided that if the Gojulas could wield the Mad Thunder's Magnesser Drills like an arm weapon, you could probably reenact that scene from the show you watched two days back on the professor's hi-def television. Those mechanics can slap on parts and scavenge however they like. You can literally merge two machines together into one, with twice the processing power as before. Mind you, Zoids typically won't respond well to suddenly sharing a body with another core and another mind, but you'll have ethical uses for this...right? For most mundane machinery, you don't need any power source besides your own, but be careful that should you make your machine too big, the internal power supply might not be enough to feed it.


-Macro Scale Engineering (GALACTA DAUGHTER OF GALACTUS) (400CP)
        So. Other species' science. Not that great. Really not that great. Even the ones that think they're amazing have a habit of being really inconsiderate about what size they make their stuff for. Thankfully, as a Plus Times One Million sized badass, you can fix it for them. Your existing mind is a marvel already but now you have a particular talent for scaling up existing science, magic and other devices or creations to a outright silly scale. You can even work a human sized mutant being into a planet scale organism that retains all the normal powers and intelligence of the original! Best of all, you're able to make your scaled up pet projects workable. They won't tear themselves apart from being made massively larger and stronger or unravel at the seams. They will probably need to really guzzle down the calories/energies now that they're so much bigger. But it's not hard to just get some pet food energy. What are stars for after all.


-Miniaturization/Efficiency (Worm) (400CP)
        You can miniaturize anything down to levels that any sane man would consider impossible. A fusion reactor the size of a watch battery would be the absolute minimum of what you are capable of, and you'd be able to make it far smaller than that. Your power also makes you a master of technological efficiency, anything you make needing barely any energy to run compared to what it should and continue to do so for a very long time. These specialties also make you a master of nanotechnology and similar pursuits. Of course you aren't barred from building something big like a giant robot, just that it'll be impossibly efficient and crammed full of more weapons and subsystems then should be possible


-Profound Seal Storage Treasure Techniques (Talisman Emperor-Mortal Dimension) (400CP)
        While true understanding of the Dao of Space is something only possessed by Immortals, there are techniques available to those of lower cultivation which still come in handy. Knowledge of this particular technique allows you to create small pocket dimensions linked to objects, effectively allowing large and powerful effects and items to be contained within a small space. This also could be viewed as a mystical form of miniaturization, shrinking things to one-thousandth of their usual size, possibly smaller in higher cultivation realms or with comprehension of the Dao of Space.


-Sohon (Legacy of the Aldenata) (400CP)
        Sohon is the semi-spiritual technique used by the Indowy to build all the best Galactic technology (like, for example, ACS). Sohon adepts are incredibly rare; of all 18 trillion Indowy, only a few hundred have the potential to become a user of Sohon at all. A Sohon adept mentally controls nanites in a special tank to grow the technology under their direction, allowing for chemical structures and molecular formations that... really shouldn't happen. While you'll never be a true adept (never ranking, for example, among human Mentats), you can at least utilize the basics, allowing you to repair Galactic tech and, with a lot of time and effort, maybe make a little of your own.


-Nanite Sciences | Nanite Removal and Control (Generator Rex) (500CP)
        Nanite Sciences (100CP)
        You possess in depth knowledge of nanite technologies. With sufficient equipment and resources you could produce and control nanite machines, possibly even recreate the nanite event or maybe figure out how to reverse its effects. But that would take a long time of additional study of nanites out in the world, still you might be one of the few who could attempt this endeavor. You possess no knowledge of the meta-nanites, and understanding how they work is beyond your grasp.
        Nanite Removal and Control (400CP)
        Many in this world would consider this is your most important ability, you can control nanites and absorb them into yourself, reverting dangerous mutations and can help people regain control of themselves. At first however this power will only work on willing targets, and will not work on incurable, especially virulent nanite infested EVOs. However with training and time, your powers can grow to circumvent these rules. Your greatest limitation is the fact that as you absorb nanites your reservoirs fill to the breaking point, causing dangerous flare ups and rendering your abilities unstable. You can purge these nanities, but figuring out how to do so in a safe way with a large amount of unstable nanites may take some effort. After this Jump your nanites can be used to heal people, whether of wounds, diseases, or possibly even mutations or others turned into a monster. Success will vary depending on factors, a mystical curse is probably beyond your nanites, a really out of this world super virus might be cured, but that's iffy. If you happen to run into other nanites in other jumps, you could control and manipulate them as well.


-Bigger is Always Better (Warhammer Fantasy - Tomb Kings) (600CP)
        You're a true visionary, even amongst the most celebrated of your peers your creations would be known as truly awe-inspiring things. Grace, realism, detail, you are almost unsurpassed in all areas. But you have a certain specialisation, one more suited for a Necrotect than any other. The bigger it is, the more complex it is, the easier it is for you to make it. The larger the tomb and more intricate its design, the less time it takes for you to have fully working plans drawn up. Even the actual construction becomes easier in the same way, with larger and larger constructions seeming to be more and more fortunate. Extra supplies turn up out of nowhere, the slaves are in perpetual good moods and shortcuts tha cut time and resources needed without lowering quality are found aplenty.


-Mini Machines (Supergod) (600CP)
        Advanced technology might be the basis of most superhumans but what if you can't skip all that and just fit a machine the size of a factory into a man's arm so he can break a castle with his fist? Pretty neat, I'd say. You have the ability to miniaturise technology to an incredible degree, fitting machines the size of small buildings into the hand or head of an ordinary human, without facing any loss in efficiency or effectiveness. If you then make them at the usual size, they'll be far better than they usually would as you pack so much into them. You're also incredibly skilled at fitting these machines you've made into the biology of living beings, creating effective and viable cyborgs.


-Prototyper (The Polity) (600CP)
        You're more than capable of inventing new and novel systems that integrate existing technologies in startlingly effective ways. Any fool can make a laser or a missile bigger; what you do is combine different technologies in new and inventive ways ; they thought Tenkian was a genius? Well he's got nothing on you. Whoever thought putting a shear-field on a missile was going to work? Here, you'll find inspiration for combining the Polity's technologies in new ways hardfields, antimatter devices, artificial gravity, AI subminds, Under-space tech, all the neat stuff even Pradortech. The technology of the Jain, Csorians and Atheter are still beyond you, however. After this jump, your inspiration works to combine different technologies from completely different origins into new devices, and removes the restriction on Jain/Csorian/Atheter tech.


-Pym's Protege (The Avengers - Earth's Mightiest Heroes) (600CP)
        You can synthesize and utilize Pym Particles to achieve scientific wonders; increasing or decreasing objects and living creatures in size, density, and weight. The exact details of how Pym Particles work are a bit fuzzy, perhaps even to Pym himself, but they seem to have near limitless potential. Growth for living beings is capped at around the size of a large building, while shrinking can go down to subatomic levels- inorganic things could potentially grow or shrink even further, but at extreme size differences the amount of Pym Particles required to sustain that size may outpace the benefit. As an added bonus, you'll also learn about Hank's ant controlling technology.


-They're Like Legos, Right? | This Is How I Want It (Kerbal Space Program) (600CP)
        They're Like Legos, Right? (200CP)
        There's robust engineering, and then there's modularity. Pick one. Except for you - you seem to have the gift of designing methods that allow for seamless mixing and matching of modular technology that lack none of the parts incompatibility and fragility you'd except from such a design paradigm. While this seems focused on Kerbin technology in specific, a little work should have you applying such a paradigm to all sorts of technologies...
        This Is How I Want It (400CP)
        Your capability of mentally designing items is vastly boosted. It's almost as if you have a mental idea space in the fashion of a construction bay with a lists of parts you have on hand that gives you an idea of what you can build at that moment... actually, that's pretty much what you have. As a bonus, you can mix and match parts in a manner roughly akin to legos, and giving you an idea of what would work and what wouldn't (and how much resources it would take to build). Mind, this doesn't mean that your mental creation will perform successfully, but it will function. As a final bonus, you can mentally hand-off the resultant creation to your Kerbals to build, and they'll do so without a mistake or screwup - meaning any snafu that results will be on your own head.


-CHEAT MODE - School for Ants (SimAnt) (1000CP)
        Miniature schools, tiny dojos and nano computers oh my! If you have the materials, then it becomes child's-play for you to build ant sized mechanical equipment as long as you have the materials available to you. Who knows what you can accomplish if you are already decently capable with minimization techniques?


-Nano-Technician | Nanoforge (Red Faction) (1200CP)
        Nano-Technician (600CP)
        Is it me or does nanomachines not sound like a word anymore? You now have a considerable talent in the field of nanotech. With time and study, you could recreate the Nanoforge, with dedication you could even improve on it. Keep in mind nanotech in this setting is exceptionally hard to work with, but can do anything from fixing a bridge, to disintegrating a starship, to enhancing human abilities.
        Nanoforge (600CP)
        Typically worn around the wrist, this device is an engineer's wet dream. Using real-time scans provided by the onboard AI, the Nano-Forge emits nanites as either a proximity cloud or projectile globs that procedurally recreate objects nearby. This Nano-Forge is restricted to repair functionality, and it doesn't work on biological material, but it does have the precision to recreate delicate electronics and the like.
